00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.030
Arise.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.400
Good.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.060
How long has it been?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.810
About three hours.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.520
That's roughly three days
on the other side, right?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.900
It's supposed to be particularly
harsh inside of a red gate.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.070
Then that Sung Jinwoo guy is probably dead.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.100
What a waste of time.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.040
No... Hang on. Sung Jinwoo isn't
with the White Tiger Guild, is he?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.480
Then why exactly is he with your strike team?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.300
He's an acquaintance of mine.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.970
He wanted to observe a C-Rank raid,
so I brought him in.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.390
Oh, is that all?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.860
You really think I'm that gullible?!

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.780
What have you dug up this time?

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.900
You've always had a knack for
sniffing out where interesting new—

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.570
Hwang Dongsoo.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.540
Take your hands off him!

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.910
You really wanna start giving me orders?

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.540
You think you're a big fish
in this tiny pond of a country?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.430
Say that again.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.130
This isn't good!

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.380
If they're not stopped soon,
we'll have an S-Rank battle on our hands!

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.400
You want some?

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.990
It was too cold... No...

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.950
If we had our gear, we could've won...

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.870
I thought it was strange none
of the ice bears had come out!

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.080
It can't be... Did those E-Ranks do this?!

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.670
No way! They couldn't be strong enough!

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.590
Wait, the Ice Slayers...

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.510
They're here, too!

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.140
Shit!

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.230
Not too shabby.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.370
Thanks to you both holding back at the
last second, my arms remain intact.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.330
I'm not sure what your interest
is in him, Hunter Hwang,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.910
but I personally re-evaluated him
two months ago.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.880
I can guarantee you
that Hunter Sung is E-Rank.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.320
The Surveillance Team has declared
Hunter Hwang Dongsuk's cause of death

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.370
as being KIA in battle against a magic beast.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.340
That's just the story for the public, though.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.680
And an obviously fake one, too.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.800
The real killer's gotta be that rich
little turd from Yoojin Construction.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.560
If you think that, then why
are you after Hunter Sung?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.840
Ain't it obvious?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.110
It's just an excuse.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.570
An excuse to kill the guy.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.340
He's a lucky bastard.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.360
Hunter Hwang!

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.180
Nobody understands
Hunter Sung's power like I do.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.210
I know for a fact that
he will survive, and return.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.890
And so, then I was out of money to buy gear!

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.850
I'm telling you! I was off by a factor of ten!

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.810
It was that expensive!

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.040
What the hell are weaklings
like you doing alive?!

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.550
Really?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.670
So much that I had to take
all of the weapons and—

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.280
You've got cold-weather gear,
blankets, tents, and even food!

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.490
Oh, is that what happened?

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.620
Hey!

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.920
Hunter Kim?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.370
My entire strike team was wiped out!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.460
Because they didn't have gear and supplies!

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.640
That's...

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.710
Who hid all of this?!

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.590
Who was the one that hoarded all this
equipment and got my friends killed?!

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.650
Oh, I see.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.920
H-Heejin...

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.510
You knew all along, didn't you?

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.470
That's why you went with them.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.670
Any collaborators will be
considered guilty, too!

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.400
I want a confession by the count of three!

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.860
One!

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.120
Two!

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.820
I know who did it...

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.840
Sung Jinwoo!

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.190
Three!

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.610
You're blaming your friends'
death on who, exactly?

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.620
Mister!

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.020
Captain!

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.570
And you dragged in a bunch of extra trouble...

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.670
Drop the Stealth. Your aura's way
too strong to not notice, anyway.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.930
Are those ice elves?!

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.770
And so many of them!

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.980
That guy must be the boss.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.480
Imagine my surprise...

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.180
Finding out that some of you scum
know what you're doing.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.930
Excuse me?

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.460
Are you calling us scum when...

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.440
...You actually understand our language?

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.780
Actually... Why do I?

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.080
You can speak the magic beasts' language?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.570
I guess I can thank the system for that.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.930
If you can understand me,
then I'll make this simple.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.140
My friend here has informed me...

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.540
that one of the humans
we've encountered is strong.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.930
He also wants to fight you—

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.090
And?

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.390
Interesting.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.910
He's not gonna go down easy.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.040
This keeps getting better.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.550
Tell me, you're not human,
so why are you pretending to be one?

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.470
Oh, I suppose you aren't aware?

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.170
We can hear a voice.
It tells us to kill humans.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.440
But we don't hear it when it comes to you.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.490
A voice...?

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.190
Could it be similar to the system directives?

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.450
The voice not directing them against me
could stem from me being the Player.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.860
There's no need for us to fight.
Let's handle this the sensible way.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.850
Hand over those humans behind you,
and we'll leave you alone.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.910
How about it? What do you say to our offer?

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.710
Who exactly are you?

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.250
Why are you fighting humans, anyway?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.290
We are—

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.480
Hand over those humans behind you,
and we'll leave you alone.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.580
What was that just now?

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.570
How about it? What do you say to our offer?

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.400
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.400
No, I won't.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.910
You intend on making enemies of us?

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.150
As you can see, the numbers are on our side.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.750
Are you sure about that?

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.550
Wh-What is this?

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.300
M-Monsters! A bunch of monsters just appeared!

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.680
Black soldiers and black ice bears?!

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.790
Are these all...

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.980
Hunter Sung, did you do this?!

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.250
What a waste of time.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.530
A waste? You really think so?

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.510
Hurry! We won't be any help
in a fight like this!

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.410
I can see why he was so confident.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.000
My summons might be immortal, but
their regeneration costs magic power.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.270
I have a lot, but it'll run out eventually.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.150
Then there's the boss.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.610
He's pretty clearly stronger than me.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.330
Even if I fought alongside Igris,
it'd probably be tough.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.950
Regular soldiers aren't going to cut it.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.370
I need a stronger fighting force.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.330
My name is Barca.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.670
What's yours?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.120
Sung Jinwoo.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.490
I haven't enjoyed a fight like this in ages.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.430
What hit me...?

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.430
Sung Jinwoo!

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.740
I was able to buy some time
with the magic soldiers.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.100
That just leaves...

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.470
Is that the best your men can do?!

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.450
Sung Jinwoo!

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.080
Die!

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.390
The humans have abandoned you, too!

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.380
Worthless! Hiding won't save you!

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.390
Sung Jinwoo!

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.050
Die!

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.290
Kim Chul. I figured that was your next move.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.690
Worthless!

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.700
Sung Jinwoo... You bastard!

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.120
You knew... this would happen...?

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.150
Damn it all!

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.090
Arise.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.630
Hiding won't save you!

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.230
Iron.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.840
From now on, your name is Iron.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.950
Isn't that interesting?!

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.230
I'll cut you to pieces first!

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.120
Not very agile, are you?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.870
Heejin, are hunter battles always like this?

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.060
Do you really think I could
be a hunter if they were?

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.500
I've never seen anything like this before.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.230
This is really happening, isn't it...?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.910
This one isn't satisfying enough.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.050
You and the knight need to face me, too!

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.540
Is that right?

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.680
You get to die first!

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.770
He was able to avoid a
fatal hit amidst all that?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.890
You're taking me too lightly, aren't you?

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.820
You're definitely strong.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.370
But what about your soldiers?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.340
I doubt your rabble will
amount to much without you!

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.730
Throwing away your weapon?! Fool!

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.980
Iron!

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.500
How dare you?!

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.610
I'll slaughter you all!

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.430
It's already over.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.200
Don't give me that!
It's over when I say it's over!

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.650
Like I said...

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.060
It's already over.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.420
Looks like I managed to beat him.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.540
Hey! Enough already!

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.000
Show some restraint.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.920
I hope this doesn't become a problem.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.870
Is it over?

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.020
Yes.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.640
We should get going now.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.110
Back out of the gate.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.910
Yes! We get to go home!

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.730
What a relief...

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.010
It felt like forever!

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.450
Finally.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.530
But first...

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.970
At this point, I believe it's
been a week inside the gate.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.370
The rest of us can stay on standby.
You should head home, President.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.770
I'm not going to do that when
we've got guild members inside.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.490
I'll wait until morning.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.900
Those are people... They're coming out!

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.360
Hunter Kim!

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.350
I knew you could pull it off!

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.830
President Baek!

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.500
Hunter Park... Hunter Go.
I'm glad to see you two are all right.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.440
What about the others?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.660
Hunter Sung!

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.060
I knew it!

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.230
The gate... closed?

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.620
Where are the others? Where's Hunter Kim?

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.190
Well...

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.170
The lower ranks are
the only ones who returned?

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.620
What in the world went on in there...?

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.940
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.660
Oh, r-right.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.940
Hang on a second.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.310
I'd like to ask you some questions.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.360
I'm exhausted.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.690
Save the questions
for someone from your guild.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.490
That wasn't me asking for a favor.
It was an order, or failing that, a threat.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.810
Six members of my guild have gone missing.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.480
And it falls to me to find out
what happened to them.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.830
That might be true, but I saved
the two surviving members.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.020
So doesn't it fall to you
to show me the proper gratitude first?

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.620
You'll have to excuse me.
You are absolutely right.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.450
I apologize.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.620
Hunter Park...

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.680
Yes?

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.280
Who in the world was that?
Not exactly friendly, is he?

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.600
Well... After he beat the boss,
his mood turned sour all of a sudden.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.360
Most likely from exhaustion.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.280
He's not a bad guy.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.820
Manager Ahn...

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.910
You need to bring him to our guild,
no matter what it takes.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.280
Y-Yes, sir!

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.520
Looks like I was right all along.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.710
Good work today.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.090
Have a safe trip home.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.210
Um... Jinwoo?

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.130
Just "Jinwoo"?

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.780
Thank you for today.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.100
I'll be counting on you tomorrow...
or whenever the next time is.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.230
Sure...

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.920
Come to think of it, it hasn't
even been a whole day out here.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.180
This was the only thing of note
I managed to earn.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.480
He must've been too high a level...

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.590
I wasn't able to extract him,
even after three tries.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.830
Damn it!

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.800
A lot of effort for not much gain.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.010
Although...

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.650
That's the third time.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.160
Jinwoo? I'm gonna eat without you!

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.810
I'm on the way.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.740
Good morning!

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.910
You're wearing... that?

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.450
Yep! Let's get moving.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.420
All right, then.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.600
We'll be picking someone up along the way.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.470
Good morning, Captain!

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.040
Oh... Good morning.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.820
Sorry about needing to get
picked up like this, Jinwoo.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.850
Just Jinwoo?!

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.140
Did you get any sleep after all that?

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.090
Not even a little!

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.690
Well, considering how late it was
when you got home...

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.520
She got home in the morning...

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.520
Good point.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.190
Jinwoo, did you—

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.190
and didn't sleep at all?!

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.280
Is that what's going on here?!

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.770
Get some sleep now.
I'll let you know when it's time.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.310
Uh, Boss...?

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.310
Oh, thank you.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.450
You know that Miss Han... is underage, right?

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.580
And?

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.910
Nothing. Never mind.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.980
Let's get to work so we can finish fast.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.510
Right, Jinwoo!

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:02.260
Right...
