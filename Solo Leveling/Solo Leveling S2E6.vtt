00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:10.573
<i>An E-rank hunter volunteered
to be a porter in an A-rank dungeon.</i>

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.493
<i>He doesn't have multiple lives to waste.</i>

00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:15.829
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.623
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.709
<i>I saw him yesterday standing in front of
the BOSS room, seemingly with a weapon.</i>

00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:23.419
<i>He's suspicious.</i>

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.965
- I'm going in to take a look.
- Eh?

00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:29.425
Anything happened inside?

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.970
No. Just personal business.

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:33.429
There's no need to worry.

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:35.598
Ah.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.979
Sorry. Could I borrow a weapon?

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:42.188
Eh?

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:43.940
Hmm...

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.442
Well...

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:49.028
Anything besides this?

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:50.864
Like swords or spears?

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:52.866
We don't have that kind of stuff here.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.285
Otherwise it's just
iron shovel or crowbar.

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:56.744
Then never mind.

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:57.871
I'll just go in.

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:03.710
Hunter Cha. Are you sure
you'll go in empty-handed?

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:10.884
This is better than going in unarmed.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:11.843
Then I'm going.

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:09.377
So many of them.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.296
If these High Orcs were to go outside...

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.925
They could easily
raze cities to the ground.

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.885
Especially those four.

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:21.556
Compared with the others,
their aura is completely different.

00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:30.148
<i>Our mission is to close the gate.</i>

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:33.860
<i>We must defeat the dungeon BOSS here.</i>

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.905
Humans.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.992
Are you fearing me?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.039
<i>How could it be...</i>

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:48.541
<i>It possesses tremendous magic power.</i>

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.501
<i>Compared to that thing,</i>

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:53.546
<i>I'm simply a third-rate Mage.</i>

00:03:54.964 --> 00:03:58.468
Why... Why did you bring us here?

00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:00.053
You are the entertainment.

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:01.262
Eh?

00:04:01.888 --> 00:04:04.182
I want to kill you off one by one,

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:09.228
torment, and devour you
to entertain my soldiers.

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:12.148
Entertainment?

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:15.526
<i>Our resolve is merely entertainment to it.</i>

00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:18.363
<i>To them, our lives</i>

00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:22.825
<i>are just toys to be discarded?</i>

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:24.619
Oh.

00:04:24.702 --> 00:04:27.997
Among those humans
sneaked in something strange.

00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:31.167
But that's fun.

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:33.961
Everyone, attack!

00:04:46.057 --> 00:04:47.683
Hymn of Protection.

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.399
Fools.

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:56.109
Gravitation Magic.

00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:00.863
Gravity Acceleration.

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:03.741
Captain!

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:10.790
Kihoon.

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:22.218
Captain Son.

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.679
This dungeon belonged to Hunters.

00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:27.140
So I'm not supposed to interfere.

00:05:27.223 --> 00:05:31.352
But, now the entire assault team
is in danger.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.356
I only ask you one thing.

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:43.948
Can you leave all
the magic beasts here to me?

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.205
Please...

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.168
How arrogant.

00:05:55.251 --> 00:05:58.296
I know your strength.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.468
Indeed.

00:06:04.552 --> 00:06:07.346
It's my first time
feeling such a strong presence.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.056
Of course.

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:12.768
It's just a pity that
we are naturally opposed.

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:14.520
Of course.

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:22.486
I will defeat you.

00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:28.492
Hm?

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:30.119
Surveillance Department?

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:32.246
What's Surveillance Department doing here?

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.831
How would I know?

00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:36.584
Someone needs to call the leader over.

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.045
Why does he work as a miner here?

00:06:39.128 --> 00:06:40.171
And for two consecutive days?

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:42.048
May I ask what brings you here?

00:06:42.673 --> 00:06:45.176
Do you know where Hunter Sung Jinwoo is?

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.761
Sung?

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:48.596
I knew it.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:50.640
Something is wrong with that guy.

00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:54.060
He stared at me with those scary looks.

00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:57.063
I thought he was about to kill me.

00:06:57.146 --> 00:06:58.689
So where is Hunter Sung?

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:00.983
He's in the gate now.

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:04.362
The assault team had no porters,
so he went in to help.

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:06.280
- Porter?
- Yes.

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.699
<i>- A porter after a miner?</i>
- That must be an excuse.

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:09.825
That guy must be up to something.

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:11.202
<i>- After becoming an S-rank Hunter,</i>
- Maybe he's killed

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:12.203
<i>- everything he does</i>
- someone inside.

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:13.120
<i>- is under surveillance.</i>
- He's the kind that could kill

00:07:13.204 --> 00:07:14.038
without batting an eye.

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:15.498
<i>I wish he would be conscious
of his actions.</i>

00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:17.458
- Um, may I ask...
- He must have killed people before.

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:19.460
Watch the news tomorrow.
You should understand then.

00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:20.419
News?

00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:23.422
- But just now, Hunter Cha
- Who cares about the darn news?

00:07:23.506 --> 00:07:25.383
- asked the same question as you.
- Just arrest him!

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:27.134
Hunter Cha?

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:33.057
What was that strange aura?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.309
I thought I was going to be torn apart.

00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:36.602
Do the magic power test again.

00:07:37.186 --> 00:07:38.062
Yes!

00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:45.778
I need to hurry up.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:51.033
I don't know how Kihoon's team
managed to kill so many High Orcs.

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:55.204
But if that power just now
came from the Dungeon Boss,

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:58.708
they would be in mortal danger.

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:03.838
Confronting my army
with your meager force.

00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.506
How naive.

00:08:06.132 --> 00:08:08.968
You'll regret underestimating us.

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:12.680
Activate skill: Monarch's Domain.

00:08:13.472 --> 00:08:18.603
This is a new job skill I learned
after reaching level 70 in Demon's Castle.

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:23.524
The Shadow Soldiers became stronger
after the battle at Demon's Castle.

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:25.693
What is going on?

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:27.194
Unbelievable.

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:29.989
I can only summon two at most.

00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:32.950
Such ominous magic power from a human...

00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:36.370
Go.

00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.026
That move he just did...

00:09:07.109 --> 00:09:09.195
He's just like Vice Master...

00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:12.573
Why would someone so strong
come here to work as a porter?

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:16.744
<i>The infantry's strength is about
that of B-rank hunters.</i>

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.499
<i>Soldiers suffer destruction four
to five times to kill one High Orc.</i>

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:24.251
<i>I must reduce the number of orcs.</i>

00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:26.003
Hymn of the Fire Dragon.

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:33.260
Your soldiers are useless.

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:34.845
Don't be too arrogant.

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:37.682
Say that to yourself.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:41.060
These soldiers can resurrect infinitely.

00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:43.229
Hymn of Protection.

00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:44.814
Accelerate.

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.277
Gravity Acceleration.

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:54.949
Gravitation Magic.

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:56.450
Accelerate.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.038
Then,

00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:03.833
I will keep destroying them
before your magic power runs out,

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:06.085
until they are completely eradicated.

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:08.754
Hymn of the Blazing Fire.

00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:21.267
<i>Does it intend to keep me at bay with its
formidable magic power</i>

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.310
<i>and long-range large area spells?</i>

00:10:23.936 --> 00:10:25.104
Alright.

00:10:25.187 --> 00:10:28.023
I am eager to see how long you can last.

00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:31.235
The results are out!

00:10:31.318 --> 00:10:34.780
The strength of this A-rank gate
is extremely close to that of S-rank gate.

00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:36.449
A mistake in detection of magic power?

00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.201
Contact the Master of Hunters.

00:10:39.702 --> 00:10:43.164
We will get ready
to support the assault team inside.

00:10:43.247 --> 00:10:44.457
Yes... Yes.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.084
It seems

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:50.963
both in number and strength,
my soldiers surpass yours.

00:10:51.964 --> 00:10:55.509
MP Your magic power
will run out sooner or later.

00:10:56.719 --> 00:10:58.596
Sooner or later?

00:10:58.679 --> 00:10:59.597
What nonsense is that?

00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:07.229
The true skill of necromancer
begins only now.

00:11:08.147 --> 00:11:09.231
Arise.

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:10.232
Hm?

00:11:11.317 --> 00:11:13.903
You turned my soldiers into the undead...

00:11:14.778 --> 00:11:17.656
Before long, you too
will become my shadow.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.617
Of course,

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:21.619
you too.

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:28.584
Could it be that

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.128
he is

00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:33.047
the lord...

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:37.510
In that case,

00:11:37.593 --> 00:11:39.178
then why am I...

00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:40.721
Why am I here?

00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:44.225
When I opened my eyes here,

00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:48.479
the same command kept echoing in my mind.

00:11:50.064 --> 00:11:52.316
Hunt humans.

00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:57.821
The reason isn't important.

00:11:57.905 --> 00:12:00.658
Just obey the command.

00:12:03.035 --> 00:12:03.994
Go.

00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:06.664
Eliminate those who stand in the way

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:10.417
and bring their corpses before me.

00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:14.004
Equivalent to S-rank gate?

00:12:14.088 --> 00:12:16.173
If the original
detection results were right,

00:12:16.257 --> 00:12:20.302
Hunter Son Kihoon should
have been able to conquer it.

00:12:20.386 --> 00:12:21.720
This was completely unexpected.

00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:23.472
If the gate has Dungeon Break,

00:12:23.556 --> 00:12:24.932
the Jeju Island incident
will happen again.

00:12:25.015 --> 00:12:27.393
Fortunately, we still have time.

00:12:27.977 --> 00:12:31.438
Mobilize all
of Hunters' forces to that gate.

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:37.486
An emergency assembly has been issued
to all A-rank and above hunters.

00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:39.530
In the worst-case scenario,

00:12:39.613 --> 00:12:43.784
maybe we'll have to ask White Tiger Guild
and Fiend Guild for support.

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:45.077
But then...

00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:49.039
We can only do our best
to prevent it from worsening.

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:23.324
My generals are gaining the upper hand.

00:13:23.991 --> 00:13:26.285
How can this be?

00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:29.204
- Let's go help them.
- Yeah.

00:13:29.288 --> 00:13:31.665
Hymn of Agony, Hymn of Blindness.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.503
Audiences aren't allowed on stage.

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:42.760
I will make sure that your arrogant mouth
can never make a sound again.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.555
Hymn of Slumber, Hymn of Lethargy.

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:48.641
Hymn of Blindness.

00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:49.808
What?

00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:52.519
It's a pity.

00:13:52.603 --> 00:13:55.064
Poison and curses have no effect on me.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.400
Hymn of Protection.

00:14:00.986 --> 00:14:03.530
I will shatter your annoying shield.

00:14:24.218 --> 00:14:25.386
What is going on?

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:30.432
Did he summon
such a large group of soldiers?

00:14:30.516 --> 00:14:31.809
Vice Master.

00:14:33.727 --> 00:14:34.603
Why are you here?

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.982
How is he? The captain is fine.

00:14:38.065 --> 00:14:39.191
That's good.

00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:43.070
What's the situation now?

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:45.280
To be honest, we're not too sure either...

00:14:45.864 --> 00:14:47.908
Quite capable, aren't you?

00:14:47.992 --> 00:14:51.912
Hymn of Rage,
Hymn of Strengthening, Hymn of Giants.

00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:57.001
I will crush you like a bug.

00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:00.462
Heck.

00:15:01.046 --> 00:15:03.215
I don't like giants.

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.426
I have bad memories of them.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.886
Hymn of the Fire Dragon.

00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:30.576
Do you still think
you can go up against me?

00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:31.910
Hmm.

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:43.464
Growing in size only makes you
a more obvious target.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.216
How could a Mage without guards

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.470
withstand an assassin-type
hunter's attack?

00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:53.891
Hymn of the Blazing Fire.

00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:09.364
<i>As expected, the dagger
couldn't inflict damage.</i>

00:16:10.532 --> 00:16:11.700
<i>So...</i>

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:32.679
Chief Woo.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:35.682
Is everyone okay?

00:16:35.766 --> 00:16:37.935
I felt a strong magic power outside.

00:16:38.018 --> 00:16:39.853
So I came in to support the assault team.

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:43.982
But it seems that was unnecessary.

00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:46.735
<i>Even the chief
of the surveillance department...</i>

00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:50.697
<i>He must be a top-tier Fighter.</i>

00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:52.574
<i>But he can even use summoning magic.</i>

00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:57.246
<i>This is the power of Hunter Sung.</i>

00:16:57.871 --> 00:16:59.581
Who is he?

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.251
You know him, right?

00:17:03.252 --> 00:17:05.003
Only a little.

00:17:07.214 --> 00:17:08.715
I don't know much.

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:12.177
From the moment the Mage lost his guards,

00:17:12.803 --> 00:17:14.888
the outcome was already decided.

00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:16.723
My body...

00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:19.935
My body will not be destroyed.

00:17:20.602 --> 00:17:24.982
Absolutely not!

00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:44.209
The BOSS was defeated,

00:17:44.293 --> 00:17:46.837
but it doesn't feel right
to take all the items.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.507
However, Shadow Extraction should be fine.

00:17:51.133 --> 00:17:52.092
Arise.

00:17:58.432 --> 00:18:01.393
You are much more docile
after turning into a shadow.

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:04.104
Name?

00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:06.106
What was its name again?

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.774
Something like Kar...

00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:10.986
Sorry, I forgot.
I'll just pick one for you.

00:18:11.695 --> 00:18:12.696
Kiba.

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:15.282
Your name will be Kiba.

00:18:16.533 --> 00:18:18.035
<i>Elite Knight Rank.</i>

00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:19.578
<i>I've never seen that rank before.</i>

00:18:20.162 --> 00:18:22.789
<i>The shadow extracted from an A-rank
Dungeon BOSS is amazing.</i>

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:27.544
<i>These High Orcs are also a major gain.</i>

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:30.297
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:32.466
<i>Chief Woo!</i>

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:35.677
<i>I was so engrossed in extracting
that I didn't even notice him.</i>

00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:37.095
Mr. Sung.

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:38.472
Mr. Porter.

00:18:38.555 --> 00:18:39.806
What happened just now?

00:18:40.474 --> 00:18:41.391
Um...

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:42.768
<i>How should I explain this?</i>

00:18:44.186 --> 00:18:46.271
We are from the Surveillance Team
in Hunter's Association.

00:18:46.939 --> 00:18:49.650
Hunter Sung Jinwoo,
who is in front of you,

00:18:49.733 --> 00:18:51.526
is our Association's top secret.

00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:56.448
We ask everyone present
to keep today's events confidential.

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:58.867
We will escort you out.

00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.412
This is the best way to avoid trouble.

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:05.832
Hunter Sung

00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:10.337
has displayed the power
of an S-rank hunter to protect all of you.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.882
Please cooperate, so he can leave safely.

00:19:17.844 --> 00:19:19.137
Please wait.

00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:23.517
You possess such immense power.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.395
I think you must have your own reasons.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.023
I won't ask why you took
on the role of Porter.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.693
But,

00:19:32.776 --> 00:19:36.154
only because of you,

00:19:36.238 --> 00:19:37.322
we were able to survive.

00:19:38.323 --> 00:19:41.285
On behalf of my team,
I express my gratitude.

00:19:46.456 --> 00:19:47.958
Ah, right.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.377
Here's your will.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.461
Huh?

00:19:53.505 --> 00:19:54.840
Then, let's get going.

00:19:57.968 --> 00:20:00.137
- Ah...
- Vice Master.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.096
Yes?

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:04.558
- Why are you holding a pickaxe?
- Huh?

00:20:06.476 --> 00:20:09.021
Would he think I'm weird?

00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:10.689
Who are you referring to?

00:20:10.772 --> 00:20:12.024
Ah... no one...

00:20:12.107 --> 00:20:13.525
I'm not referring to anyone.

00:20:16.361 --> 00:20:19.489
Fortunately, everyone came back safely.

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:21.158
Having said that,

00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:25.954
following the White Tiger Guild,
we also received his help.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.999
He can summon a large number of soldiers.

00:20:29.082 --> 00:20:31.126
His speed rivals that
of an assassin-type hunter.

00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:33.462
He even has the ability
to control dead magic beasts.

00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:36.089
It's really hard to believe.

00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:40.218
Hunter Son,
between Hunter Sung Jinwoo and me,

00:20:40.302 --> 00:20:42.637
who do you think is stronger?

00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:50.979
Raid missions are usually handled
by multiple hunters doing their part,

00:20:51.063 --> 00:20:53.648
complementing each other's weaknesses.

00:20:53.732 --> 00:20:55.817
That's the common sense.

00:20:57.361 --> 00:21:01.656
Master, if you're facing
the most difficult A-rank dungeon,

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.284
could you deal with it alone?

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:07.746
No.

00:21:07.829 --> 00:21:12.084
It seems that my title
of The Ultimate Hunter has become a joke.

00:21:13.835 --> 00:21:15.212
Master.

00:21:15.295 --> 00:21:17.047
I understand.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.673
Please make sure to...

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:21.051
I will do my best.

00:21:26.515 --> 00:21:27.891
Jinwoo.

00:21:30.685 --> 00:21:32.312
Sorry, I'm late.

00:21:32.896 --> 00:21:35.190
The matter of the guild master,
how did it go?

00:21:36.024 --> 00:21:37.567
You must have talked to your dad about it.

00:21:39.152 --> 00:21:40.278
Jinwoo.

00:21:40.904 --> 00:21:43.407
To be honest, that thing...

00:21:44.574 --> 00:21:45.867
We're right outside
the Hunter's Association now.

00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:47.494
That's really nice.

00:21:47.577 --> 00:21:49.329
Actor Lee Minsung has awakened
the power of a hunter recently.

00:21:49.413 --> 00:21:52.124
These people
must have come to interview me.

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:56.128
Lee Minsung, the man who has it all,

00:21:56.211 --> 00:22:00.090
now possesses strength that
surpasses human capabilities?

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:01.758
Well...

00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:03.927
Doesn't feel bad.
