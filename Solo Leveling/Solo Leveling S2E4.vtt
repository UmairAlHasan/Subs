Streaming By ARCloud Api

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.260
I've obtained two ingredients
of the Sacred Life Elixir.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.580
Just one more.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.280
The Purified Blood of the Demon King.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.540
I want to be certain
to get my hands on it.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.400
My level has increased well
in the demon fortress.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.230
But officially,
I remain E-rank.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.420
To continue evolving,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.520
I must participate
in higher-ranked raids.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.320
Okay, the comedy has gone on long enough.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.230
I can no longer hide my power.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.060
I'm going to get my rank re-evaluated.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.100
Those who wish to
have their rank evaluated, come this way!

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.380
I wonder
if the fishing will be good today.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.720
He looks like a C-rank.
And he looks like an E-rank.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.870
Let's see...

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.850
Baek Yunho speaking.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.830
Here's Hyun Gicheol!

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.810
What is it?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.420
He's here!

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.270
What? Are you joking?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.920
It's him, I swear!

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.440
The Hunter Sung
has come for a re-evaluation!

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.280
Well, please follow me.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.240
Okay.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.410
I'm coming right away.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.130
No need to stress.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.050
The evaluation only takes an instant.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.670
I need to get a good rank
to make money

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.570
and get back my daughter
and my wife who left me.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.800
Look at that.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.590
With a D-rank or higher,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.130
these recruiters
will try to enroll you.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.750
Everything will be fine.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.260
Unless you're E-rank,
it'll work out.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.520
"Unless you're E-rank", huh?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.660
Next!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.650
I'm coming.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.570
What's your name?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.150
Sung Jinwoo.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.830
– This is for a re-evaluation?
– Yes.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.910
The evaluation system
hasn't changed.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.870
Place your hand
on the black sphere.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.960
Huh?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.390
An error?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.710
Please try again.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.700
Okay.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.030
This is strange...

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.220
Hey! Is there a problem?

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.590
Boss!

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.390
Something's wrong.
No matter how I try, it's not working.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.170
What? Let me try.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.720
You see? There's an error.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.200
Boss?

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.710
This is not
a system error...

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.240
It's impossible to evaluate him!

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.160
What? I don't understand.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.540
His power

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.760
exceeds the limit
of our detector!

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.190
But then...

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.170
Yes!
He is the 10th South Korean

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.300
to obtain S-rank!

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.280
What about the ant wing case?

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.220
The corpse is being analyzed.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.730
We will compare
the collected data

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.100
with the data
we already possess.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.860
The results will be available
in some time.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.320
Good.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.230
Things have been hectic
lately.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.860
I've heard about the red portal.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.020
Someone outside
the White Tiger Guild

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.560
apparently defeated its boss.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.250
Who was it?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.000
I was present that day,
but not until the end.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.060
I don't have the details.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.880
Too bad.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.800
Huh?
There's a commotion in the hall.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.940
Probably a hunter
dissatisfied with their evaluation.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.480
I'll go see.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.700
I'll accompany you.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.090
I'm curious
about what's happening.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.210
He exceeds the limit?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.200
Seriously? Is that possible?

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.730
I've never seen this before...

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.980
Of course! This has only happened
nine times before!

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.700
But then... this guy
is the 10th S-rank hunter?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.830
Okay.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.730
Mr. Ahn was right!

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.710
I can't waste time!

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.870
We will update
your license.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.070
Is there a problem?

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.710
Hey, look!

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.070
It's Choi Jongin,
the Hunter Guild Master!

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.240
So this is him,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.840
the flame master,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.150
the one they call
"the Ultimate Weapon"?

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.040
I owe my previous nickname to him.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.610
I see...

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.850
Now I understand the commotion.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.980
Nice to meet you! I'm
the Hunter Guild Master,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.980
Choi Jongin.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.500
Do you already have a guild in mind?

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.970
How about we discuss a bit...

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.630
Sorry, I don't have time.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.720
– What...
– He ignored Choi Jongin?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.000
Tell me, Mr. Woo,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.090
I did introduce myself properly, right?

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.940
Yes, I can confirm.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.320
My arrogance will be my downfall.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.290
Hunter Sung...
Was he really S-rank?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.740
He left without a trace.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.200
An assassin type?

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.930
President Baek?

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.960
President!

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.500
I see the type.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.730
The White Tiger Guild
is far from here.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.350
He must have rushed here.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.720
This proves Sung Jinwoo
is worth it.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.620
So this was him,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.680
the mysterious savior
of the red portal.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.020
Choi Jongin?

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.690
He's the last person
I wanted to know about this...

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.000
She seems like
she could wake up at any moment.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.010
Just wait a little longer, mom.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.700
I understand
that I was completely wrong.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.260
The Surveillance Department
observes hunters

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.960
and sanctions those
who break the law.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.770
I thought I was good
at judging individuals...

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.140
The Department is watching me?

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.370
Not as a potential criminal.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.250
We are the only ones
who can control hunters.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.570
Well, even we

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.630
can't do anything against S-ranks.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.310
There's someone
who wants to meet you.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.960
Nice to meet you.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.930
I'm Go Gunhee, president
of the Hunter Association.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.280
First, I congratulate you
on awakening to S-rank.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.300
What?

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.740
A more precise evaluation
isn't of much interest.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.620
The result obtained today
proves you are S-rank.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.330
Why force me to do it, then?

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.310
When they ask you
to retake an evaluation?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.040
It's to buy time.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.420
So we have the opportunity

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.250
to approach people like you.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.600
To my regret,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.430
we don't have many
exceptional hunters.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.250
The lure of profit and the fame
of large guilds work against us.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.170
Woo Jincheol, right here,
is one of our best.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.940
Despite that, he's A-rank.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.400
I'll get straight to the point.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.490
I would like you
to join our ranks.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.430
I'll offer you an important position
in the Association.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.300
Why go to such lengths?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.480
It's hunters
who now protect this country from monsters,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.470
not the government.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.200
At the heart of this system
are the five major guilds.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.650
These five powers struggle
to maintain equal footing.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.750
If you join one of them,
the balance will be broken.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.210
We are the only ones
who can control them

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.750
and maintain order in this country.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.020
And my help is useful?

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.240
You are more than capable.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.600
Especially since I'm getting old...

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.520
What do you say?

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.110
It's an attractive offer.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.250
A position in the Association

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.040
is like opening the path to success.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.930
The government,
the mass media...

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.270
In my opinion, President Go
has influence everywhere.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.910
Plus, he is very powerful.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.570
He's the first S-rank in this country.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.400
His mana is incredible, not to mention
his stature at 80 years old.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.880
He remains stronger than me,

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.500
even though I've worked hard
to gain power.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.930
Certainly,

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.630
if I accept this proposal,
my life will change.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.120
Hunter Sung?

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.830
Sorry, but I refuse your offer.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.040
Money comes first...

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.260
I'm thirsty for battle.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.720
You mean

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.710
you want to fight monsters?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.680
Exactly.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.060
My place
is inside the dungeons.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.500
This is incredible...

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.790
His eyes are screaming the truth.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.400
It's been a long time
since I felt this.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.530
I didn't know my heart
could still beat so strongly.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.920
If I were 20 years old

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.620
or even just ten years younger,
I would have loved to fight alongside him.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.880
Very well.
I can't force your hand.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.010
Since my sister is home alone,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.760
I'll take my leave.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.900
Thank you for giving me
your time.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.380
When I learned that even an S-rank
can do nothing against age,

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.050
I really fell from high.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.720
I don't mind, but I can't really hold my liquor.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.120
I don't care.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.070
I wonder if he likes alcohol.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.720
The Association mainly handles D to E rank dungeons.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.650
I need to quickly gain levels to treat my mother.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.720
I can't stay stuck.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.960
I still have more in store!

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.250
What do you want from a loser like me,

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.700
deputy director?

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.710
I wanted to ask you a question.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.750
This man, Ilhwan Sung...

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.420
are you sure he's a monster?

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.430
Do you think a human can do that?

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.850
He is nothing more than a monster.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.710
Very well.
I wish you a good recovery.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.070
When you're feeling better,
come to the office.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.400
Where did he go?

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.440
We are searching for him,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.810
but it's unlikely

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.490
that we can capture a man
capable of beating you.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.210
Damn!

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.690
I forbid you
from approaching my family.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.910
I'm saying this for your own good.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.760
Even in death,
you won't be able to escape me.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.700
The humiliation is total!

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.000
Haunting me, even after death?

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.220
Does he think he can intimidate me?

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.720
I know where he's going.
I just need some equipment.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.900
I'll get some artifacts
and crush him!

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.630
The artifacts.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.540
Even if they are
artificial relics,

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.160
for hunters,

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.410
they are unimitable quality equipment
from the greatest artisans.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.180
Online, you can find plenty,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.160
now that the number
of hunters has exploded.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.710
But why does it cost an arm?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.790
I want to equip myself properly
for the demonic fortress.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.690
There was nothing useful
in the shop.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.820
The Orb of Avarice can be given.
I should be able to sell it.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.270
The best available artifacts

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.340
offer a 20 to 30% increase
in statistics.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.730
This orb can double
magical damage.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.530
That should be worth a good sum.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.430
But I would have to explain
how I obtained it.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.060
That would certainly cause a stir.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.240
If I had a rank A raid
in my history, maybe,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.500
but how can I join such a raid
as a rank E?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.830
They're recruiting people!

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.070
These records are from four years ago?

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.350
He looks like a child
in this photo.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.110
Could he be a rank fraudster?

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.060
He has brushed with death
many times.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.170
That's unlikely.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.140
I see that he held on,

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.320
despite his repeated injuries.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.100
He acts to pay for his mother's hospital
and his sister's school expenses.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.780
In other words, he supports
his family.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.830
Young people like him are rare
these days.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.960
By the way,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.150
he would have joined
a Hunters raid.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.570
Were those just empty words?

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.390
He couldn't resist the lure of gain.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.310
According to the report,

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.110
he joined a team of miners.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.390
- Miners?
- Exactly.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.540
This boy
is totally unpredictable.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.270
- You're rank E?
- Yes.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.850
Have you ever mined?

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.130
No, never.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.250
Oh, you're a fighter? I'm not worried
about your physical condition.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.120
There are plenty of people like you here.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.710
Relax,
everything will be fine.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.680
Thank you.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.420
These large-scale raids
require work distribution.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.460
The attack squadron
takes care of the monsters.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.020
Miners are responsible
for extracting crystals.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.140
Finally, the collection team
recovers the corpses.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.840
Many personnel,
for a huge profit.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.800
I imagine they're busy.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.370
Step back, please.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.820
I don't like being blinded,
but there's no choice...

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.300
Tanks, take position.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.160
Your turn.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.810
I held back,
to avoid carbonizing

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.900
and rendering their corpses useless.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.610
I've eliminated
all enemies in the area.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.700
We can proceed.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.500
Be careful of the burning smell,
you with the developed sense of smell.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.790
The attack squadron is back!

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.840
They've already cleaned up,
except for the boss?

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.510
I sensed his incredible aura
when I crossed paths with him yesterday.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.890
But leaving such a dungeon
without a scratch

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.980
proves how skilled he is.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.520
Oh, the second-in-command of the Hunters
is also present!

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.560
This woman...

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.750
She's the vice president
of the Hunters

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.530
and the 9th S-rank hunter
in the country.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.800
Cha Hae-in,
nicknamed "the dancer".

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.070
Incredible...

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.930
How many people in this world
emit such an aura?

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.740
I sensed an extremely heavy presence.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.320
Did I hallucinate?

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.640
For an instant,
I thought Mr. Go was here.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.800
It disappeared
in a fraction of a second.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.330
His senses are really sharp.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.850
Alright, guys! Get to work!

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.240
After the attack,

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.470
it's time for the miners
and collection team.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.820
Ho! Heave!

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.530
There's a bit of slack here!

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.700
Mana waves
are emanating from the end of the corridor.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.090
They must be coming from the boss
of this A-rank dungeon.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.210
He's more powerful than Vulcan or Metus
from the demonic fortress.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.440
I want to go there.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.760
I'd like to check the power
of an A-rank boss.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.260
Did you hear?
The newbie is rank E.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:08.970
Rank E? Seriously?

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.280
The boss has lost his mind!

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.810
Rank E hunters get the same treatment
wherever they go...

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.030
Anyway, it'll be over soon.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.960
Hey, get to work!
Don't just stand there!

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.680
Can't you see it's narrow,
so...

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.390
I...

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.360
Go at your own pace, actually.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.640
Is he really rank E, this guy?

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.740
Boss,

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.460
are you sure he's rank E?

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.420
Yes...

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.220
He's incredibly strong.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.930
I have the feeling

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.110
that Hunter Sung
is a gift from heaven.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.300
Well, let's take a break!
It's snack time!

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.460
Sung, you coming?

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.370
I'd like to finish this zone.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.670
As you wish.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.520
Don't go too far from here, okay?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.480
Okay.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.710
Finally alone, damn!

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.100
This is the perfect opportunity!

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.960
I have about an hour.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.120
Let's take a look.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.180
Is this the boss's lair?

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.710
I was right, he's stronger than Metis.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.690
I'm aware that I must not defeat him...

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.460
otherwise, the portal will close.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.150
That would cause huge damage to the Hunters.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.260
However,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.290
nothing stops me from poking him a bit.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.610
What are you doing here?

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.130
I asked a question.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.250
What are you doing here?

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.880
