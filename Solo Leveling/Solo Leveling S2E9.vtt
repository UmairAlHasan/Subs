00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:26.155
But, uh, that's normal.

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:29.795
There's such a thing as struggle.
It's enough that it exists in history.

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:32.795
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:36.175
It's the hunter who's abnormal.

00:07:36.575 --> 00:07:37.595
Think about it.

Yunho.

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:54.915

Shut up and drink your wine.

00:07:57.695 --> 00:07:59.775

I've seen it a million times so far.
I've seen the system work wonders.

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:58.935
Originally E-rated, I've grown this far as well...

00:09:03.195 --> 00:09:04.455
Just believe it.

00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:04.355
Mom...

00:10:09.555 --> 00:10:10.455
Please...

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.095
Wake up...

00:10:13.275 --> 00:10:16.455
I'll keep fighting, I'll keep getting stronger.
All for you.

00:10:20.055 --> 00:10:21.315
Please wake up soon...

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:23.355
Mom...

00:10:28.115 --> 00:10:31.555
I haven't been able to concentrate today.
Why is that?

00:10:42.035 --> 00:10:43.655
Nice warm breeze...

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.195
You're Jin-woo.

00:11:17.475 --> 00:11:18.435
Right...

00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:23.735
How long have I been asleep?

00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:27.355
4 years ...

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:28.775
You slept for 4 years...

00:11:29.435 --> 00:11:30.495
What about Jenya?

00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:33.655
She's fine.

00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:39.495
Thank you, Jin-woo.

00:11:40.595 --> 00:11:43.095
You kept your promise.

00:11:46.015 --> 00:11:48.015
You've gotten so much more mature.

00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:50.915
I can't believe I'm covered in bruises like this...

00:11:51.495 --> 00:11:54.895
You must have done a lot of things to push yourself, right?

00:11:59.815 --> 00:12:01.355
It must be very hard for you...

00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:11.015
I'm fine...

00:12:11.735 --> 00:12:12.935
It's okay...

00:12:15.495 --> 00:12:16.655
It's okay...

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:29.655
Thank you.

00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:31.715
your appearance (honorific)

00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:39.255
Hmm...

00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:44.235
You said the drowned sleeper woke up.

00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:46.365
Yes, I know it's unbelievable...

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:50.575
And, uh, there's nothing physically wrong with the patient.

00:12:50.575 --> 00:12:54.595
The patient and his family.
want to be discharged immediately...

00:12:59.675 --> 00:13:01.975
Jenya, you've grown up so much...

00:13:03.035 --> 00:13:04.655
Mom...

00:13:09.215 --> 00:13:11.555
Sorry...for making you worry...

00:13:12.935 --> 00:13:15.115
All the hard work paid off.

00:13:16.015 --> 00:13:19.335
I finally got my real reward.

00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:27.115
Thank you for being here today.

00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:29.815
As you know.

00:13:29.815 --> 00:13:32.735
Nowadays, all over the world, due to

00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:36.695
A winged ant-type monster flew in from Jeju Island.
They're causing all kinds of disasters.

00:13:37.175 --> 00:13:38.575
Faced with such a situation

00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:44.175
The Hunter's Association has decided
To launch the 4th Jeju Island Raid.

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:49.115
In this battle, there are not only domestic S-class hunters.

00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:51.635
We'll also be working with Japan.

00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:54.475
Addition of 10 S-class hunters to the front line

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:58.055
and hunters up to level A

00:13:58.055 --> 00:14:00.995
It will also be responsible for maritime policing and defense of the mainland.

00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:03.675
Supporting this operation together

00:14:03.935 --> 00:14:06.135
Keeping you all safe.

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:11.275
This time we're going to get it.

00:14:16.715 --> 00:14:17.735
Eun Suk-go...

00:14:18.415 --> 00:14:20.635
Honestly, I'm scared.

00:14:21.275 --> 00:14:22.775
Me too.

00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:29.395
But those who are powerless to fight
Must be many times more afraid than we are.

00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:31.075
Just get it over with.

00:14:31.595 --> 00:14:34.175
This is something that only we, with our power.
We have the power to do it.

00:14:34.755 --> 00:14:37.915
We can't let this country
This country can't be an ant's nest.

00:14:38.415 --> 00:14:39.315
bastard

00:14:40.775 --> 00:14:43.275
Let's see how I can twist that thing...

00:14:45.275 --> 00:14:47.155
Yunho is also very reassuring.

00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:49.155
Whether it's personality or ability

00:14:50.175 --> 00:14:53.035
Someone who can back him up in a pinch.

00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:55.175
It's just me and you.

00:15:07.035 --> 00:15:07.995
Hey...

00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:10.575
When I'm not looking at you, that's it...

00:15:10.975 --> 00:15:14.435
Okay, after 4 years of absence, we'll start by cleaning the house.
Let's start by cleaning the house.

00:15:14.655 --> 00:15:16.375
The three of us will clean up together.

00:15:18.535 --> 00:15:21.055
It's a lot older than it should be.

00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:23.115
The dirt doesn't come off too well.

00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:26.395
After all, it's the home I grew up in.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.195
That's true.

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.175
This is the image I've been waiting for...

00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:33.135
nevertheless

00:15:33.735 --> 00:15:35.155
And yet the heart is full of uneasiness...

00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:39.395
In the course of his activities as a hunter

00:15:40.115 --> 00:15:43.695
Have I stepped over the line
The line that must never be crossed

00:15:45.715 --> 00:15:46.635
your appearance (honorific)

00:15:47.195 --> 00:15:48.435
Huh? What is it?

00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:53.655
Has your father been in touch with the family...

00:15:58.515 --> 00:16:00.255
By the way, I saw the news.

00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:02.215
You've become a hunter.

00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:03.335
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:07.155
Your dad was a fireman before he was a hunter.

00:16:07.655 --> 00:16:10.615
It's because I think he's
I think he's so cool when he puts his life on the line.

00:16:10.615 --> 00:16:11.735
That's why I decided to marry him.

00:16:12.095 --> 00:16:14.815
You've got his blood all over you.

00:16:16.755 --> 00:16:20.375
I want to be a doctor, too.
I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to cure people.

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:21.735
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:21.735 --> 00:16:23.435
Jenya inherited it too.

00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:25.375
Yeah, right?

00:16:26.075 --> 00:16:26.995
hello (polite)

00:16:28.215 --> 00:16:29.075
Phew...

00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:31.455
The press conference was hard work.

00:16:32.015 --> 00:16:32.675
(nonverbal grunt as interjection)

00:16:33.215 --> 00:16:35.195
And thank you for coming along.

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:35.995
will not (act, happen etc)

00:16:36.915 --> 00:16:40.145
That said.
I can't believe he came by after the press conference.

00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:42.395
Thomas B. André

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.735
S-Class National Power Level Hunters in the United States

00:16:46.775 --> 00:16:49.575
I had my hopes up for him, too.

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.515
After all, it's at this point in time

00:16:51.515 --> 00:16:52.615
That's normal.

00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:58.135
But
Those who have the equivalent of national military power

00:16:58.135 --> 00:17:01.015
Unlikely to intervene in other countries

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:02.315
yea

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:04.575
But then.

00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:05.795
And why would he ...

00:17:06.135 --> 00:17:07.695
Maybe it's as he himself said.

00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:10.755
Just traveling through.

00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:14.655
Or about the yellow hunter.
To give us a hard time.

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:18.695
Or maybe to confirm something.

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:22.835
By the way, there's still no news from Sung Hunter?
Still no news from Sung Hunter?

00:17:22.835 --> 00:17:24.475
No, I just got in touch with him.

00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:26.415
He should be here soon.

00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:30.235
Departure in 4 days

00:17:31.095 --> 00:17:33.735
This mission is a long time coming.
It's been our dream for years.

00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:36.035
Can you help us?

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:40.295
This is the perfect opportunity to upgrade

00:17:40.535 --> 00:17:41.915
It's a shame to let it go.

00:17:42.835 --> 00:17:44.755
That's what I would have thought.

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:50.585
I...

00:17:52.855 --> 00:17:54.215
It's the magic wavelength...

00:17:55.955 --> 00:17:57.235
It's really something.

00:17:57.235 --> 00:17:59.175
I can sense it from this distance.

00:17:59.935 --> 00:18:04.275
The S-class hunters are now
They're stretching out in the gym right now.

00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:06.775
If you're interested.

00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:08.455
Should we go over there?

00:18:22.455 --> 00:18:23.635
Master Bai

00:18:23.935 --> 00:18:28.075
You're still so young. How about some more underhand work?

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.975
I'm just a company employee now.

00:18:31.295 --> 00:18:32.135
Master Ma

00:18:33.355 --> 00:18:37.615
Not many S-class hunters get together like this.

00:18:38.315 --> 00:18:40.315
The magic wavelength of the party

00:18:40.315 --> 00:18:42.835
I think they're the ones who sent it.

00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:45.535
What about the white hunter being suppressed?

00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:48.635
But if President Baek were to use his full strength.

00:18:48.635 --> 00:18:50.475
Horse hunters shouldn't be able to resist.

00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:52.115
How are you?

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:54.375
The guy in the costume.

00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:57.095
It's Mr. Ma Dong-suk from the Guild of Fame.

00:18:57.935 --> 00:18:59.875
Why doesn't he go all out?

00:19:00.315 --> 00:19:03.175
It doesn't feel like the other guy is the one who needs him to let go.

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:06.815
It's not convenient for him to show his strength in front of so many people

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:09.475
When he fights with all his might

00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:11.755
It'll turn into a real monster.

00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:14.635
So the rumor that he's a shapeshifter hunter is true.

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:18.975
By the way, those guys over there.
They're from the Knights' Guild...

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:22.295
interjection of wonder, shock or admiration

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:24.015
They're here too.

00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:28.095
Japan's S-class hunters

00:19:28.095 --> 00:19:31.435
and Chairman Takuji Goshima

00:19:31.955 --> 00:19:32.755
Uh-huh?

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:34.155
Who's that?

00:19:34.795 --> 00:19:35.755
interjection of surprise

00:19:35.755 --> 00:19:39.375
He's Sung Jin Woo Hunter, who recently became an S-class.

00:19:39.715 --> 00:19:41.575
Looks like a very powerful assassination hunter.

00:19:41.975 --> 00:19:42.855
(negative prefix)

00:19:42.855 --> 00:19:44.735
He's a mage hunter.

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:47.915
Is that a mage type...

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:50.775
oh (interjection indicating that one has just learned sth)

00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:55.375
Isn't that the one who broke our Min Sung's stage?
Sung Hunter?

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.795
No wonder the flavor here has changed...

00:20:06.575 --> 00:20:08.775
This is actually the top fighting force in this country.

00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:09.895
It's a little disappointing.

00:20:10.495 --> 00:20:13.655
Maybe it's because I've been watching Mr. Goshima fight.

00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:15.675
Don't think they're S-Class at all

00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:17.615
I think it's hard to say.

00:20:17.615 --> 00:20:19.495
I can't pretend I didn't hear that.

00:20:20.075 --> 00:20:21.235
Miss Translation

00:20:21.235 --> 00:20:23.115
You were just laughing at us, weren't you?

00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:25.315
I can hear it even if I don't speak the language.

00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:27.535
You're the president.

00:20:27.535 --> 00:20:28.355
May I ask if you're...

00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:31.595
This is the Guildmaster of the Order.

00:20:31.595 --> 00:20:33.175
President Park Jong-soo

00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:34.455
Park Jong-soo?

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:36.155
I've never heard of it.

00:20:36.755 --> 00:20:40.075
Mr.... Mr. Chairman is an A-class hunter.
He's not an S-class hunter.

00:20:40.075 --> 00:20:42.175
So you probably haven't heard of him.

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:45.215
But we're still one of the top five guilds in the country.

00:20:45.215 --> 00:20:47.075
- On the raid here is to act as a guard...
- What are you doing?

00:20:47.695 --> 00:20:50.695
It's better if you don't make it worse.

00:20:51.015 --> 00:20:54.265
No, they're saying we're weak.

00:20:54.695 --> 00:20:56.395
All right, calm down.

00:20:56.575 --> 00:20:57.495
It's a great opportunity.

00:20:58.055 --> 00:21:00.675
Since we're all here.
Let's have a goodwill tournament.

00:21:00.675 --> 00:21:02.195
Only S-class hunters are allowed to compete.

00:21:03.355 --> 00:21:05.015
I'm being ostracized, am I?

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:08.255
You can decide the content of the competition.

00:21:09.015 --> 00:21:10.215
Sounds good.

00:21:11.255 --> 00:21:17.375
But exclude the mage-type and non-combatant hunters.
And non-combat hunters are excluded.

00:21:17.815 --> 00:21:18.755
No problem.

00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:22.235
So, only combat hunters are in the fight.

00:21:22.555 --> 00:21:25.275
Grabbed by the wrist or touched on the back.

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:28.215
And if you fall to the floor, you're ruled a loser.

00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:31.415
And it's not one-on-one.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.295
Instead, the whole team is on the field together.

00:21:34.295 --> 00:21:38.235
After all, when the time comes to be there
It's almost certain to be a melee.

00:21:41.435 --> 00:21:42.595
I get it.

00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:43.715
Let's do it.

00:21:46.415 --> 00:21:47.975
Our players are

00:21:48.275 --> 00:21:52.255
Car hunters, forest hunters, horse hunters.
With four white hunters.

00:21:52.755 --> 00:21:57.215
We are the Tabata Hunters, the Kumamoto Hunters.
Hoshino Hunter and Tanaka Hunter, four of us.

00:21:59.275 --> 00:22:00.095
in that case

00:22:00.415 --> 00:22:02.995
Let's get this goodwill tournament started.
