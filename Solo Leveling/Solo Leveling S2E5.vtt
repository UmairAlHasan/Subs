SOLO LEVELING SEASON 2
-ARISE FROM THE SHADOW-

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.500
What are you doing there?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.800
I'll ask one more time...

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.790
What are you doing there?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.630
How careless...

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510
What was I thinking?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.290
I got lost and ended up here.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.140
Got lost?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.350
Are you from the mining team?

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.060
This is the Boss Room.
Please step back.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.490
Cha Hae-In.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.020
She truly lives up to her reputation.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.570
I didn't notice her at all
until she spoke.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.910
Did I see it wrong?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.790
Wasn't he just holding a weapon?

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.620
I am sorry.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.290
Please hurry out.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.780
If you agitate the Boss,
the mining team may get annihilated.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.710
I understand.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.010
Umm, hold on.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.590
Yes?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.520
He isn't smelly.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.440
What are you doing?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.460
Are you really a Hunter?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.750
Uh, yes...

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.410
E-Rank...

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.450
Sung Jinwoo.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.750
It's nothing.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.420
Be careful on your way back.
This dungeon is very large.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.500
Okay.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.960
Is it because his rank is too low?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.920
He's not smelly at all.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.170
On the contrary,
he smells rather pleasant.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.770
I heard you met Hunter Cha
when you were lost.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.600
You are so lucky.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.060
We can only admire her from a distance.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.030
She patrols to protect us from the Boss,
sacrificing her own rest time.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.490
She is a very reliable young woman.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.790
That's why she came
to the Boss Room.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.580
Hunter Cha feels uncomfortable
with the scent of other Hunters.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.250
The scent of Hunters?

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.630
I heard it's due to her unique constitution.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.850
She always covers her nose
with a handkerchief.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.470
Yeah.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.180
But her reaction to me...

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.390
I don't have the distinct scent of a Hunter.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.870
In the Red Gate,
that guy said something similar.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.400
Is it because I am a player?

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.990
The only one favored by the system.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.450
What exactly is the so-called player?

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.410
Thank you for your work.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.740
Thank you.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.330
Thanks to you,
we finished work early.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.960
Never thought we'd finish earlier
than the recovery team.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.250
You have a talent for this.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.300
I thought you secretly used the excavator.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.920
You flatter me.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.180
I've been in this field for a long time,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.170
but I've never come across
a talent like you, Sung.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520
Sung.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.520
Are you interested in working for me?

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.480
You'll be rewarded fairly.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.980
Well... I'm glad to hear you say so.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.440
But this is a one-time thing for me.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.780
I see.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.950
That's a pity.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.510
But could you help for one more day?

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.170
One more day?

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.870
Yes.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.910
Tomorrow, there are back-to-back
A-Rank and C-Rank raid missions.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.790
I have a re-evaluation the day after tomorrow.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.880
Today, I've gotten a grip
on the raid process.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.090
Wait... Tomorrow?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.260
Hunters Guild also have
raid missions tomorrow?

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.180
A-Rank and C-Rank missions simultaneously?

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.010
Yes.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.560
But the 2nd assault team
will be coming tomorrow.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.810
The 2nd assault team...

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.640
That is our strength.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.730
We can raid A-Rank Gates
with two groups of people.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.150
No one else in the country can do it.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.150
Then, where should I report tomorrow?

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.820
So you are willing to help?!

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.330
I will talk to the boss about
doubling your salary tomorrow!

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.080
Eh? But you don't have to...

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.040
Come on, that's the least I could do.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.710
Could you help investigate
Sung Jinwoo in the mining team?

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.220
Do you mean Hunter Sung?

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.210
Do you know him?

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.720
Mr. Choi said the same to me yesterday.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.060
Mr. Choi?

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.060
Yes.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.460
But all the information about him
has been sealed.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.020
Eh?

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.110
I've never seen the association

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.220
seal someone's information
who isn't a top-level hunter before.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.170
I see.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.650
His behavior in the dungeon...

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.410
Mr. Choi ordered an investigation...

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.270
The blocked information...

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.330
There must be something behind it.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.540
I've met so many Hunters.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.010
But this is my first time
meeting someone with a nice scent.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.010
Oh, he's here!

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.520
Sung!

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.130
Good morning.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.150
Sung, have you been eating well?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.020
Hi, Sung.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.690
Jinwoo, please don't get hurt today.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.450
I haven't felt this way in a long time.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.040
Let's eat together today.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.040
Yeah, you came after all.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.840
Okay.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.590
Alright, let's start with the C-Rank dungeon.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.300
The assault team is about to come out.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.510
Let's get ready.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.550
He's doing a great job again.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.050
Mm-hmm.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.140
With Sung here, our progress is much faster.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.020
Thanks to you, we can rest and go into
the A-Rank dungeon after lunch.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.880
The recovery team is also amazed.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.190
Do you really not want to work with us?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.990
I'll pay you five times!

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.820
I'm sorry.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.330
Excuse me.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.570
Captain Son Kihoon.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.730
Can I borrow someone
from your mining team?

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.990
The person in charge of carrying
our luggage couldn't come.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.290
From us?

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.790
The recovery team should
be better at moving stuff.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.590
They said they are also short-staffed.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.460
Hmm...

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.550
If you go in with the assault team,
you will receive the risk allowance.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.730
Portering in an A-Rank dungeon
is not fit for low-rank Hunters.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.270
Offering more money
wouldn't change that.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.980
No one wants to go?

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.570
I'll go.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.110
What? Sung?!

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.490
That's too reckless!

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.910
There are high-rank magic beasts inside!

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.750
That money isn't worth
risking your life for.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.120
It's alright.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.250
Actually, I'm quite bold.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.340
It's not about being bold...

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.300
He just joined the team yesterday,
so he doesn't understand anything.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.010
What is his rank?

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.180
E-Rank.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.180
So please find someone else.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.600
No, he'll do it.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.850
Eh?

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.100
I am the leader of this attack team.
My name is Son Kihoon.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.860
I am Sung Jinwoo.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.030
It's even bigger than yesterday.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.860
But the magic power is not as strong
as that of the Gate yesterday.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.760
Be assured.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.830
If it's too dangerous, they won't send us,
the second team.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.460
Six A-Rank and three B-Rank Hunters.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:27.840
Although there are no S-Rank Hunters,
they wouldn't be a second team in other guilds.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.050
Let's set off.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.220
Hunters Guild has two assault
teams of this level.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.980
The magic power inside
is less than yesterday.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.690
But for some reason,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.460
I have an ominous premonition
similar to confronting the Red Gate.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.660
I must be overthinking.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.030
Don't be nervous.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.660
Kihoon...

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.970
Ah.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.960
All the Hunters here
led by the captain are very strong.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.460
If you stick with us,
you won't be attacked by magic beasts.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.670
Thank you.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.630
After this raid mission is completed,
I will be officially appointed as the captain.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.710
Although I'm not as good as
Captain and Vice-Captain,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.010
I'm nonetheless an A-Rank Hunter.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.570
I can do it.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.770
They got ready without any instructions.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:34.410
It's coming.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.930
It's Dungeon Jackals!

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.130
Get down.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.690
Why are Dungeon Jackals
in an A-Rank dungeon?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.010
Are they rare magic beasts?

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.200
Because they are C-Rank magic beasts.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.410
It wouldn't be surprising
if they all died in the dungeon.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.580
Collar?

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.370
Please look here.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.290
It seems they were being raised.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.750
Do you mean they were spared
and used as hunting dogs?

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.390
It seems my premonition was correct.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.610
High Orcs.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.940
How could it be?

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.410
Their power is astonishing!

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.760
He-ah!

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.670
The taunting skill is ineffective!

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.930
They targeted the back line?!

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.130
Watch out!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.760
We won't be taken down that easily.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.640
That strike was ineffective?!

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.360
Their magic resistance is too strong!

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.290
It's too strong!

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.080
I can only hold it back
for a few seconds!

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.290
I'll summon help now.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.040
Those who obey my command,

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.210
take the enemy's head.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.090
This is my trump card
that consumes a lot of MP.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.600
How about it?

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.150
Healer!

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.280
We need you here!

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.110
Wait, I'll be right there!

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.780
We are outnumbered!

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.700
If we're surrounded,
we will be done for!

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.660
Move in groups of three!

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.080
Or we'll be dispersed.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.290
There are so many High Orcs
that can rival A-Rank Hunters alone.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.210
B-Rank members cannot
handle these magic beasts.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.680
Please, everyone, don't die!

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.730
Next one.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.150
Don't move.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.690
I'll heal you right away.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.360
What just happened?

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.740
What happened?

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.330
These High Orcs suddenly...

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.960
Now!

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.290
Attack back!

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.720
As an outsider, I really don't want
to stand out here.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.170
But I cannot watch people die.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.310
I must weaken them without being noticed.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.230
Don't play any tricks.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.640
Is anyone seriously injured?!

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.520
It seems everyone's okay.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.900
It's a miracle that we're still alive.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.740
Hey, something weird happened
during the battle.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.850
I also felt that they suddenly slowed down.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.700
Gina, was it you who did it?

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.280
I couldn't do that.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.100
I only know attack magic
and a little bit of telekinesis magic.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.370
And the other members
mainly focus on firepower, right?

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.250
Without assassin-type Hunters,
that shouldn't be possible.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.970
But, no matter what, we won.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.550
Right.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.180
We're really lucky.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.390
That porter underestimated our assault team.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.560
With a magic caster on the team,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.800
how could he think that
his stealth skill wouldn't be detected?

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.360
However, it's true that we survived
because of him.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.570
It seems he has his reasons.
So I'll let him off this time.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.250
Captain Son, do we still keep going in?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.620
This place is too dangerous for us.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.790
We need at least two more healers
and three more mages.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.840
I understand how you feel
about your first time as the captain.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.600
But, I also think we should retreat first.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.810
I can understand
he doesn't want to give up.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.560
Everyone wants to conquer the dungeon.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.520
But, if he is a wise leader...

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.280
Then...

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.150
Let's retreat for now.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.280
I was afraid you would
want us to keep going.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.030
I'm not that foolish.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.870
This is...

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.830
A barrier.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.080
A high-level barrier.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.580
It wasn't here when we entered.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.960
Can we lift it?

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.540
Given some time, I can do it.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.010
There's an entity capable of using such
high-level magic in this dungeon.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.530
Fortunately, we chose to turn back.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.970
We can't conquer this place by ourselves.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.140
What's this magic power?

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:02.480
No way...

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.310
The dungeon boss?

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.020
We need to lift it.
Help me.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.070
Understood.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.770
Okay.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.860
Even a B-Rank Hunter can feel
such a powerful magical fluctuation.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.470
Why wasn't it detected outside the Gate?

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.410
Curse magic?! Is it a trap?!

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.620
Semi, cast divine magic!

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.340
What's wrong? What are you doing?

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.050
Captain Son...

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.930
There are roughly 50 of them.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.520
- Kihoon...
- Don't move.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.980
We'll die pointlessly
if we fight them here.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.580
Helelakkohina.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.990
Vitualanaka.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.120
Helelakkohina.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.750
Vitualanaka.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.710
Helelakkohina.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.400
Vitualanaka.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.180
Humans.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.300
My name is Kargalgan.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.520
I wish to see you humans.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.350
Kargalgan.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.730
Did you block the entrance?

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.770
Yes.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.110
I am the great sorcerer
of the glorious orc tribe.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.610
Is there a stronger being
than you in the cave?

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.330
Who do you think can surpass me?

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.450
Choose.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.540
Either die at the hands of my soldiers,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.000
or come to see me.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.710
We will come to see you.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.600
Hunter Sung.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.220
Yes.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.190
As soon as we see the boss,
we will attack immediately.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:13.420
No matter what, it should be distracted,
and cannot maintain the barrier.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.630
You take the opportunity to escape
and find the main assault team.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.860
Are you trying to get killed?

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.490
Our mission is not to return
alive from the dungeon,

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.120
but to close the Gate.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.670
I also have a favor to ask of you.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.840
This is my short will.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.850
Please pass it on to my family.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.300
We must complete our mission.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.260
But you are different.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.220
Please make sure you leave here alive.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.810
This desperate situation
is just like ours in the Double Dungeon.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.810
Those people back then...

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.400
But these people...

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.060
I'll take it for now.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.030
But I hope things
don't turn out that way.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.830
He isn't here.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.500
Did he resign from the mining team?

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:12.960
Hunter Cha?

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.920
Why did you come?
Isn't today your day off?

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.640
May I ask if Hunter Sung Jinwoo was here?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.010
Ah, Sung.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.220
He just went in as a porter.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.520
Eh? Then...

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.520
You mean he's inside the Gate now?

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.800
Humans.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.430
Welcome.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.680
SOLO LEVELING

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.180
EPISODE 17: THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE TRAINED TO DO

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.940
EPISODE 18: DON'T LOOK DOWN ON MY GUYS
