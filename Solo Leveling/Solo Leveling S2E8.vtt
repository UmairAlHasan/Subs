<i>Streaming By ARCloud Api</i>

00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:11.382
I surrender!

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:13.635
I surrender.

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:14.886
Please spare my life.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.097
<i>That voice...</i>

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.265
<i>Are you...</i>

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:29.275
I'm... I'm sorry.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.985
We lost.

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.196
Please spare me.

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:08.666
You attacked us, and now
you want me to spare your life?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.085
I killed all your companions.

00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:14.547
It is the duty of a knight
to protect the lord.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.798
As long as I am safe,

00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:17.842
I'm sure they will be happy.

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:21.054
<i>How could you say that...</i>

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:23.014
Never mind.

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:30.104
My chance!

00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:37.528
What's this supposed to mean?

00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:41.157
I will do anything
as long as you spare my life.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.825
So please show mercy.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.702
<i>This one...</i>

00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:49.165
Can you get the floor entry permit?

00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:50.875
The entry permit...

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.336
It's currently being kept by my family.

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.880
If you spare my life,
I can give it to you.

00:02:56.547 --> 00:03:00.051
I know the locations
of all the upper-level permits.

00:03:00.134 --> 00:03:03.513
If you can ensure the safety
of me and my family,

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:04.597
I can take you there.

00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:07.809
So you hid them.

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:10.812
No wonder I can't get them
by defeating opponents.

00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:12.730
But the question is...

00:03:14.774 --> 00:03:18.402
Can I trust you?

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:21.114
Of course...

00:03:21.697 --> 00:03:25.326
I... I'm not lying to you.

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:29.247
Alright.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.041
As long as I get the permit,
I will spare you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.962
Thank... thank you very much.

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:37.964
By the way,

00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:40.425
who are you people?

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:00.570
I am Esil, the eldest daughter
of the Radiru family.

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:03.865
No, that's not what I wanted to ask.

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:07.118
<i>I thought I could get information</i>

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:10.455
<i>about the system
from magic beasts other than Baruka...</i>

00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:13.958
In your minds,

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.752
do you constantly hear voices
telling you to kill humans?

00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:17.962
Huh?

00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:20.465
Hmm... No.

00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:23.009
But we do hear another command.

00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:24.886
What command?

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.804
Protect our space.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:28.764
Since when did it start?

00:04:28.848 --> 00:04:30.975
Since we came here.

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:32.935
<i>Since you came here?</i>

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.937
Where were you before?

00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:35.980
The Demon Realm.

00:04:36.063 --> 00:04:39.567
We found ourselves in this place
when we came to our senses one day.

00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:43.154
What were you doing in the Demon Realm?

00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:47.074
A war...

00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:50.536
We were preparing for a war.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.246
<i>A war?</i>

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.581
Who were you going to fight?

00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:58.794
A formidable enemy who is so strong that
all the demons had to unite to fight.

00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:02.673
At that time, we were on the eve
of fighting that powerful enemy.

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:07.011
This is not disclosable information.

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:08.596
The conversation has been blocked.

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:11.015
This is not disclosable information.

00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:12.600
The conversation has been blocked.

00:05:12.683 --> 00:05:13.935
This is not...

00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:20.691
<i>Seems I can't ask further questions.</i>

00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:26.906
Here is the disaster caused by
a winged ant magic beast

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:29.575
landing on the Japanese outlying islands

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.077
and its subjugation record.

00:05:31.953 --> 00:05:34.330
A total of 294 civilian casualties.

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:38.000
108 hunters engaged in the battle.

00:05:38.084 --> 00:05:39.418
Among them,

00:05:39.502 --> 00:05:42.797
4 E-rank hunters, 1 C-rank hunter,
and 1 B-rank hunter died.

00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:46.759
Just one magic beast
caused such casualties...

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:51.055
The A-rank hunter
who arrived later killed it.

00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:52.807
Only then was it subjugated.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.977
So, the strength
of the winged ant is A-rank.

00:05:57.144 --> 00:06:00.690
It's consistent with the conclusion
of the investigation department

00:06:00.773 --> 00:06:01.691
after dissecting the body.

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:08.698
That island is 120 kilometers
from Jeju Island.

00:06:09.573 --> 00:06:12.868
If those ants gain
stronger flying ability,

00:06:12.952 --> 00:06:15.204
they can land
on the southern tip of our nation.

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:18.708
Immediately request support from Japan.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:20.835
Warn neighboring countries

00:06:20.918 --> 00:06:23.713
- to be vigilant.
- Yes.

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.881
What was bound to come is coming.

00:06:25.965 --> 00:06:27.675
Now every second counts.

00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:32.638
I wanted to strike first
before there were casualties.

00:06:33.222 --> 00:06:37.184
Now, as the president
of the Hunter's Association,

00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:40.730
I order to commence
the fourth Jeju Island raid mission.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.275
{\an8}Sorry...

00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:47.570
{\an8}I don't know why I fainted.

00:06:47.653 --> 00:06:49.739
No, it's okay.

00:06:50.364 --> 00:06:52.033
Do you feel unwell?

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:54.285
No, I'm fine.

00:06:54.368 --> 00:06:56.245
You are worried about me.

00:06:56.996 --> 00:06:58.456
Sort of.

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.626
By the way, are we almost there?

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.295
Ah, yes.

00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:06.547
That is the castle
where the Radiru family resides.

00:07:06.631 --> 00:07:08.716
The permit is inside.

00:07:09.925 --> 00:07:12.428
Who did you bring back?

00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:14.388
- Esil!
- Eh?

00:07:14.472 --> 00:07:16.557
Didn't you see it?

00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:20.061
Those countless troops
lurking in that man's shadow.

00:07:20.144 --> 00:07:21.520
{\an8}<i>Oh...</i>

00:07:21.604 --> 00:07:23.022
{\an8}<i>He is very perceptive.</i>

00:07:23.105 --> 00:07:26.692
If you want to deceive my daughter
and then take over the castle,

00:07:26.776 --> 00:07:28.527
don't expect to get out alive.

00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:30.946
Father, wait.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.449
I have promised her.

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:36.661
As long as you give me the permit,
I won't harm you.

00:07:39.205 --> 00:07:42.333
<i>I heard that he had defeated
Vulcan and Metus.</i>

00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:46.462
{\an8}<i>That means he isn't
an opponent we can defeat.</i>

00:07:48.172 --> 00:07:49.548
{\an8}Heck...

00:07:57.556 --> 00:07:59.100
I'll take it.

00:07:59.892 --> 00:08:02.978
So you're done, aren't you?

00:08:03.062 --> 00:08:04.647
Then leave quickly.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.107
There's one more thing.

00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:08.567
I need to borrow her.

00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.569
{\an8}- Eh?
- What...

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.574
Ah, no. I need her as a guide.

00:08:15.658 --> 00:08:18.786
{\an8}She said she knows the locations
of the permits on each floor.

00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:21.914
{\an8}Can you guarantee my daughter's safety?

00:08:21.997 --> 00:08:23.624
Yes.

00:08:26.335 --> 00:08:28.838
Alright then. I understand.

00:08:29.422 --> 00:08:32.007
That's it. Please show me the way, Esil.

00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.259
Okay.

00:08:45.646 --> 00:08:46.647
Guild master.

00:08:57.491 --> 00:08:58.325
Good.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:00.411
Now the 89th floor is completed.

00:09:02.413 --> 00:09:05.166
Igris and Tank have both leveled up.

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.795
Their strength is about S-rank and A-rank.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:11.797
I'm also gaining combat power.

00:09:13.883 --> 00:09:15.176
Darn it...

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:20.347
Now the gifts prepared
for negotiations are wasted.

00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:22.057
You can take them back.

00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.018
That's not possible.

00:09:24.101 --> 00:09:27.229
The floors above the 90th floor are
managed by high-ranking nobles.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.691
They are on a different level
than the lower ones.

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:34.487
So, getting permits
through conversation might be more...

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.114
If I were weaker than you,

00:09:37.615 --> 00:09:38.908
would you have a conversation with me?

00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:41.452
That's how things are.

00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:45.331
Aren't you competing in rankings
with other Demon Nobles?

00:09:46.123 --> 00:09:49.710
I will make the Radis family the first.

00:09:49.794 --> 00:09:52.963
It's Radiru... Wait.

00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:57.676
Jinwoo, why did you spare my family?

00:09:58.344 --> 00:09:59.887
Because I like you.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.097
Huh... What?

00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:04.141
<i>First it was Jinho, now it's Esil.</i>

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:08.813
<i>I do get along well
with simple-minded people.</i>

00:10:09.605 --> 00:10:11.774
- Esil, you can go back.
- Eh?

00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:13.818
Eh?

00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:16.487
You said the next enemies
would be stronger.

00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:18.739
I also promised your father.

00:10:18.823 --> 00:10:21.242
Just tell me the location of the permits.

00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:23.410
I can handle the rest myself.

00:10:23.494 --> 00:10:26.288
Am I so useless to you?

00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:29.416
It's not like that.
I just think you must be tired.

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:32.419
Thanks for everything. Thank you.

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:35.756
I will follow you till the end.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.593
I want to see what kind of achievements
you will have.

00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:43.597
I understand. Then let's go.

00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:46.517
Yes.

00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:51.814
<i>As Esil said,</i>

00:10:51.897 --> 00:10:54.191
{\an8}<i>the difficulty increased drastically
from the 90th floor.</i>

00:10:55.025 --> 00:10:57.403
<i>The strength and quantity
of the guardian magic beasts</i>

00:10:57.987 --> 00:11:00.072
<i>are completely different from before.</i>

00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:04.702
<i>But I'm still climbing
to the top step by step.</i>

00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:07.371
<i>I must</i>

00:11:07.454 --> 00:11:10.666
<i>get the materials for the Elixir of Life.</i>

00:11:10.749 --> 00:11:11.875
<i>For that...</i>

00:11:15.713 --> 00:11:20.384
Both Hunter Cha and I received a call
for the fourth Jeju Island raid mission.

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:21.385
Yes.

00:11:21.468 --> 00:11:25.097
Besides us, it seems President Baek
from the White Tiger Guild

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.602
and all S-rank hunters in the country
have also been called.

00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:31.812
<i>Then Hunter Sung too...</i>

00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:35.941
Moreover, it has been officially
decided to cooperate with

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:37.776
neighboring country this time.

00:11:38.402 --> 00:11:40.779
- Do you mean Japan?
- Yes.

00:11:41.322 --> 00:11:43.657
Considering the flying ability
of the winged ants,

00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:46.118
they are also within the attack range.

00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:47.828
This is a natural decision.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.956
As long as they can be eliminated,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.250
it doesn't matter who does it.

00:11:54.793 --> 00:11:56.170
When do we take action?

00:11:56.253 --> 00:11:57.963
It has not been decided yet.

00:11:58.047 --> 00:12:00.507
But I think it will start soon.

00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:04.470
And, to discuss the battle plan,

00:12:04.553 --> 00:12:08.932
the hunters from ultra-large guilds
will come to our nation today.

00:12:13.479 --> 00:12:14.855
<i>I finally reached the top floor?</i>

00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:17.066
But there's no one here...

00:12:32.623 --> 00:12:35.209
<i>That is the lord of the demons,</i>

00:12:36.543 --> 00:12:37.544
<i>Baran.</i>

00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:47.304
<i>His aura is overwhelming.</i>

00:12:47.388 --> 00:12:49.223
<i>Can I defeat him?</i>

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.309
<i>Feels like I'm about to be
dismembered by the killing intent.</i>

00:12:53.018 --> 00:12:55.187
<i>So strong that even Esil can feel it.</i>

00:12:55.896 --> 00:12:57.481
<i>Alright.</i>

00:12:57.564 --> 00:12:59.149
<i>It's hard to deal with it in the air.</i>

00:13:00.192 --> 00:13:02.945
<i>A flying dragon?
Are there non-demon creatures as well?</i>

00:13:27.928 --> 00:13:29.763
There are quite a lot of them.

00:13:30.347 --> 00:13:32.307
What... what should we do?

00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:35.477
Jinwoo!

00:13:36.103 --> 00:13:37.312
{\an8}<i>I know.</i>

00:13:40.023 --> 00:13:41.275
Come out.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.838
That's amazing...

00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:05.591
Jinwoo can use
this kind of combat technique.

00:14:06.467 --> 00:14:09.261
But, that is the Demon Monarch Baran,

00:14:09.344 --> 00:14:10.596
the ruler of this place.

00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:13.432
Jinwoo is just an invader,

00:14:13.515 --> 00:14:15.059
someone to be eliminated.

00:14:16.018 --> 00:14:19.563
Which side should I choose?

00:14:49.468 --> 00:14:50.803
{\an8}<i>This is not ordinary lightning.</i>

00:14:51.345 --> 00:14:53.472
{\an8}<i>It's a wide-range attack
with a stun effect.</i>

00:14:54.556 --> 00:14:56.642
<i>Although the soldiers can be revived,</i>

00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:59.686
<i>if they keep getting hit by it,
my MP will soon run out.</i>

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.647
<i>I must act before that.</i>

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.158
<i>Start with the wings.</i>

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.578
<i>My stealth was detected.</i>

00:15:25.712 --> 00:15:27.422
<i>It can track me.</i>

00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:29.341
<i>Darn it, I will be caught up.</i>

00:15:29.424 --> 00:15:30.968
Kiba, Igris!

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.413
You finally came down?

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.167
Looking up all this time
made my neck sore.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.209
This is much better.

00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:13.802
Nice to meet you all.

00:16:13.886 --> 00:16:17.181
I am Hanekawa from the Draw Sword Guild.

00:16:17.264 --> 00:16:20.058
This is the guild master, Goto Ryuji.

00:16:20.142 --> 00:16:23.645
He will communicate with you
through my translation.

00:16:24.229 --> 00:16:25.564
Draw Sword Guild.

00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:30.277
A super large guild in Japan
with eleven S-rank hunters.

00:16:30.903 --> 00:16:34.406
It's reputed to be
the second largest in Asia.

00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:35.782
And...

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:38.827
Goto Ryuji, who manages the entire guild,

00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:41.580
does live up to the reputation
with his awe-inspiring aura.

00:16:42.497 --> 00:16:43.373
First of all,

00:16:43.457 --> 00:16:46.835
thank you for accepting the proposal
to form a joint assault team

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:48.045
and work together.

00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:49.379
Please don't say so.

00:16:49.463 --> 00:16:52.674
We were the ones
who first requested support.

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:54.635
We should thank you for your consent.

00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:57.095
As shown in the files,

00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:00.015
we have come to many conclusions

00:17:00.098 --> 00:17:02.893
from the information you provided

00:17:02.976 --> 00:17:04.937
and the dissection results
of the winged ants.

00:17:05.938 --> 00:17:06.897
Among them,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.858
there are two key points
related to this operation.

00:17:10.817 --> 00:17:11.985
One is its lifespan.

00:17:12.527 --> 00:17:15.405
Ants grow rapidly after hatching,

00:17:15.489 --> 00:17:17.324
but they only live for about a year.

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:18.659
That means,

00:17:18.742 --> 00:17:20.369
as long as the queen ant is killed,

00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:23.538
the remaining ants will die after a year.

00:17:24.164 --> 00:17:27.042
The other is the ants' behavior patterns.

00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:29.628
From the records
of the past three raid missions,

00:17:29.711 --> 00:17:31.838
we found that ants

00:17:31.922 --> 00:17:35.509
are attracted by powerful enemies,
that is, strong magic power.

00:17:35.592 --> 00:17:39.721
This time, we will use this habit
to devise a combat plan.

00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:44.810
<i>We also noticed the ants' actions.</i>

00:17:44.893 --> 00:17:48.063
<i>I didn't know
they analyzed it so thoroughly...</i>

00:17:49.314 --> 00:17:50.565
As for this operation,

00:17:51.233 --> 00:17:55.237
among the eleven S-rank hunters
of Draw Sword Guild,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.031
ten will be dispatched, including me.

00:17:59.199 --> 00:18:00.909
Ten out of eleven...

00:18:01.493 --> 00:18:03.870
We will lure out all the ants.

00:18:03.954 --> 00:18:07.708
Your responsibility
is to kill the queen ant.

00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:10.877
But this way, you will have to
face thousands of ants...

00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:14.673
If we're only acting as bait,
this is not a problem.

00:18:14.756 --> 00:18:19.303
The AI simulation also indicates
that this is the best tactic.

00:18:20.053 --> 00:18:24.766
<i>Indeed, we can't mobilize
ten S-rank hunters...</i>

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.226
<i>Well...</i>

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.728
I understand.

00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:31.606
Then we will plan
the operation details based on that.

00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:42.743
<i>I have no chance
MP to restore MP with a potion.</i>

00:19:02.262 --> 00:19:03.889
<i>It blocked a vital hit.</i>

00:19:33.627 --> 00:19:35.337
<i>MP Is my MP depleted?</i>

00:20:19.131 --> 00:20:20.674
Darn it, the dagger...

00:20:31.393 --> 00:20:33.353
<i>It's too strong.</i>

00:20:35.188 --> 00:20:36.440
{\an8}<i>No way.</i>

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:38.400
<i>I can't dodge it.</i>

00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:46.032
{\an8}<i>Now!</i>

00:20:46.116 --> 00:20:47.826
{\an8}<i>As long as I have strength
that I've specially boosted</i>

00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:50.454
<i>and 'Ruler's Hand'...</i>

00:21:07.095 --> 00:21:10.140
<i>This is the end!</i>

00:21:24.237 --> 00:21:25.864
Jinwoo...

00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:48.053
Jinwoo!

00:21:48.136 --> 00:21:49.554
Esil.

00:21:49.638 --> 00:21:51.556
Go back and report to your father.

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:53.642
From now on,

00:21:53.725 --> 00:21:56.061
the Radis family will be
at the top of the rank.

00:21:56.937 --> 00:21:58.063
Jinwoo.

00:22:02.067 --> 00:22:03.944
It's not Radis.

00:22:04.027 --> 00:22:05.195
It's Radiru.

00:22:05.275 --> 00:22:07.275
