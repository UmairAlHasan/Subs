00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.690
B-Boss...

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.840
Where did these guys come from?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.500
Right, I guess you haven't seen them before.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.760
They're a part of one of my skills.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.110
This kind of thing is possible? Using skills?

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.260
It's hard to explain, but yeah.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.580
Boss...

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.240
The least you could do is let me
collect the essence stones.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.380
Th-Thank you!

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.180
Oh, no!

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.270
Jesus!

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.120
Hey. Could you not yell like that?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.680
Don't panic. They're just unconscious.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020
Then again, it makes sense
you wouldn't understand.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.700
It's not like I know English.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.210
I'm human.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.430
I want to go home.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.970
Cheers!

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.070
That's nineteen raids cleared, as per our deal.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.660
And it's thanks to you that we
pulled it off safe and sound, Boss.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.170
So, what's next for you?

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.900
First comes passing the written
exam at the Association

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.990
so I can get a guild master's license.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.460
Once I have that, I'll start
negotiating with my father.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.250
I see.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.330
What about you? What are your plans?

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.920
I'll probably be out of touch for a while.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.260
Need to travel for a bit.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.010
What?

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.560
Boss, if you think I'm a pain
to put up with, you can just say it.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.120
I won't need to bother you anymore, so...

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.470
Are you drunk already?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.330
I have a brother. He's ten years older.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.670
He's never liked me... and we never
really did anything brotherly together.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.670
On the other hand, you not only saved my life
but did so much to help me, as well...

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.800
I can't help but wish
<i>you</i> were my older brother.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.650
In that case...

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.040
Starting today, I'll consider you
my little brother.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.460
Bro...!

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.480
Eat up! All the meat you want!
I'll make sure more is grilled in time!

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.680
Whoa, slow down!

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.930
Do you like lemon juice on yours?!

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.520
No! You really are drunk, aren't you?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.630
I've never been more sober in my life!

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.480
Seriously... You can be such a handful.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.180
Do we know where he's from?

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.350
He claims to be a foreign hunter.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.480
Says he was trapped inside a gate
ten years ago, unable to leave.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.940
And that at some point he found an exit
that took him to a gate in America.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.990
That'd be unprecedented. Anything else?

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.260
He can't speak English,
so we're waiting for an interpreter.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.510
We can't rule out the possibility
that he's a humanoid magic beast.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.310
And if he is?

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.600
I requested the assistance
of an S-Rank hunter—

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.060
a fellow countryman of his
who lives in Washington.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.840
Mr. Hwang, I take it?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.460
We'll begin questioning as soon as he arrives.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.680
That's a relief.
Do we have name for our guest?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.490
I'm not positive about
the pronunciation, but...

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.250
I think it's Il-hwan Sung.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.970
I'll be gone for a week.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.740
First work, now travel?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.700
You're keeping busy lately.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.710
Plenty to do, that's all.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.980
So? Who are you going with?

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.470
Like I told you, a friend.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.020
Seriously, though, when'd you meet her?!

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.760
I was around level 20
when I fought the Cerberus.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.690
I'm three times that now.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.020
This should be easier.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.070
I guess I should move along.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.240
A quest?

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.380
"Demons roam this castle.
Gather their souls."

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.540
To clear it I need to collect...

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.960
ten thousand demon souls?!

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.000
There's that many in here?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.350
I haven't lost sight
of my real objective, though.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.660
I don't care how many thousands
of demons there are...

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.350
I'll deal with them.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.190
You want to take over the guild?

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:30.990
Yes, sir.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.130
And you're asking this, knowing full well
that Jinsung is already working on it?

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.790
I think that his plan for bringing in
someone from the outside to run the guild

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.500
bears too many risks for the company.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.380
This hunter of yours.
His name is Sung Jinwoo, right?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.270
The double dungeon, the raid where
Hwang Dongsuk's team was wiped out,

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.730
and the incident where a Surveillance Team
hunter murdered a group of convicts...

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.100
He was present for all three of those,
and yet made it out of each alive.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.430
He's also been a participant in all
of the raids you've run, correct?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.700
And in the red gate that the White Tiger
Guild encountered the other day,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.250
it was apparently Hunter Sung
who led the survivors to safety.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.560
You were only able to get that guild
master's license with his help, right?

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.210
And you're still asking me
to turn over the guild to you?

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.890
Even so...

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.920
Even so, I want to be the one
running the Yoojin Guild!

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.430
The way that Jinsung wants
to do things will—

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.110
All right. We'll try it your way.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.020
Under one condition.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.290
I hear the White Tiger Guild has been
preparing to scout Hunter Sung

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.610
ever since the red gate incident.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.450
I want him with us instead.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.450
Can you arrange that?

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.670
I'll do it!

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.200
I hope so.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.470
Not sure why, but it doesn't seem
like I can extract these demons.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.230
Seems like a waste, considering the numbers.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.940
An entry permit for the next floor?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.870
Makes sense. And I guess
that's where I use it.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.050
This dungeon really is huge, though.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.090
An entire city inside of a building.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.370
All this walking is getting to be a pain.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.180
The ice bear pack leader...

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.550
Talk about huge.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.210
All right, let's get going.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.200
What a pain in the—

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.340
Nice!

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.730
I think I'm gonna call you "Tank."

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.720
It's Miss Hae-in!

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.280
We hardly ever see her here.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.620
But she always looks amazing!

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.740
But why?

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.830
Why keep the reports of the flying ants
confidential, instead of publicizing it?

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.520
Association orders.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.320
They say making the information public
at this stage would only cause a panic.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.250
But...

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.710
Don't worry. For the time being,
we need to build our strength.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.530
As the largest domestic guild,

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.060
doing so will help us execute
our duties, as well as expand.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.830
I was afraid this was an S-Rank
dungeon when I got that key...

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.860
But these demons seem to be around
the upper end of B Rank.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.630
There's a ton of them, and they
get stronger the higher I go...

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.880
But by only killing the demons I need
to proceed past each floor,

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.660
I've been able to make pretty brisk progress.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.790
That said, if the Demon's Castle is laid out
the same way the original tower is,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.140
that'll mean 100 floors.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.300
How strong will I be
by the time I reach the top?

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.180
How long will my supplies hold out?

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.550
Then there's my promise to Jinah.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.090
This is turning into a battle against time.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.890
Just how far can I get?

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.050
This one's red.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.840
Hunter Sung wasn't home.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.980
Only his sister is there,
and all she knows is that he's on a trip.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.220
We came all the way to his house for nothing.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.580
There's been no record of him
participating in any raids recently,

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.510
but also no sign of him leaving the country.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:12.590
The last trace the Association has of him
is smack in the middle of a city.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.170
Wait, you were able to find all that out?

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.200
It's part of the job.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.090
Where could he be?

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.370
I'll take on the big boss-class enemy.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.020
I want the rest of you
to wipe the others out.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.990
Now that I have more points
in my intellect ability,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.950
I'm able to summon more soldiers and
have more magical power to maintain them.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.170
Combat's become a lot easier.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.180
That said... Is he ever gonna get up?

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.140
I guess if he won't move, I'd better—

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.760
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.190
All I did was punch him...
Did I overlevel my strength?

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.610
This is just like with the Cerberus!

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.170
Iron!

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.720
This flurry of attacks isn't slowing...

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.880
How is someone so big so fast?!

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.760
Still, sooner or later, I'll have my opening.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.790
Now!

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.380
Got you!

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:00.940
No—

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.450
This thing can anticipate my moves?

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.160
The only part of him that looks vulnerable
are those beady little eyes.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.790
I need to keep him from
being able to zip around.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.750
What can I use?

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.430
There!

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.350
Got a little too focused on me, didn't you?

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.360
They say you're a magic beast who can talk.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.550
And like I said, I'm no beast.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:14.290
If you need proof, I'll submit
to a DNA test, or whatever.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.650
Shut up. I don't want to hear your voice
unless it's to answer my questions.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.520
I'm pretty pissed about having my fun delayed.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.270
Unbelievable... They even went
and wrote a bunch of crap down.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.720
Can I ask you something?

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.910
I told you to shut up!

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.400
How much has humanity learned
about gates and magic beasts?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.040
Huh?

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.180
How much do you know about
gates and magic beasts?

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.290
What exactly are you asking?

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.950
The dungeons, the gates, the beasts...
They're just the tip of the iceberg.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.420
The power capable of bringing forth
the ultimate catastrophe has awakened.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.010
And what's that supposed to be?

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.950
An ultimate catastrophe.
Not much else I can say.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.320
And?

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.900
My goal is to avert that catastrophe.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.040
I've had enough chitchat.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.980
Do you realize how many hunters
there are in the world?

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.820
Put enough of them together...

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.660
Numbers won't help. Not against this threat.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.200
They'll be devoured and used against us.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.330
You seem fairly strong yourself, but...

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.120
But what?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.690
Not every day you see a magic beast
with a name of his own.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.340
Not to mention a wife and two kids.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.640
Do you remember your son's name?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.350
Jinwoo.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.830
What's with the murderous glare?

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.980
I'm not answering your questions! Got it?

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.950
You will this ti—

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.800
Screw you. No.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.320
But I'll tell you this much:

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.790
Your son's dead.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.000
If you have anything to tell him, you can
do it when you meet in the next world!

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.490
I'll admit, this is getting kind of one-sided.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.430
Shocked by how tough my soldiers are?

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.320
Didn't expect it to turn out like this?

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.320
I guess even the undead can feel fear.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.040
Oh, well.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.050
Over here!

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.320
Get a move on!

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.690
I'd heard that fights between S-Ranks
could change the shape of the landscape,

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.540
laying waste to everything...

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.720
I guess we should consider ourselves fortunate.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.310
Yeah. It could have been much worse.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.940
It was so fast... Almost instantaneous.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.950
Mr. Hwang was defeated.
Faster than the damage could spread.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:25.150
I'm out of food. I guess this
is as far as I go for now.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.630
This is the 75th floor.
So there's 25 left, I think.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.140
Still a long way to go.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.450
But the gains were worth it.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.440
The earring I got from
the giant on the 50th floor,

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.930
and the necklace from the skeleton just now...

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:49.230
They're useful enough individually,
but the set bonus is the cherry on top.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:54.690
And that empty space tells me there's
one more boss-level beast to go.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.440
This Sphere of Avarice isn't half bad, either.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.760
It doesn't do anything for me personally,
but it doesn't have to be me who uses it.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.830
In the hands of my magic soldiers,
it'll double their firepower.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:13.900
And finally... I was able to choose the
cursed random loot box as a quest reward.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.020
I was worried I'd never
get another chance at it.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.730
Another key. I had a feeling it might be.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.380
No details? Then when and where
am I supposed to use it?

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.890
Well, it's not like I was really
after the key, anyway.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.910
On the 50th floor, I got a World Tree
Fragment from Avaricious Vulcan.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:45.870
And on the 75th, I got Spring Water from Echo
Forest by beating Metus, the Guide of Souls.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.330
That's two out of the three ingredients
for the Elixir of Life.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.960
Just one more. One more,
and then Mom will be better.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.230
The next time I come here, I'll finish it.
