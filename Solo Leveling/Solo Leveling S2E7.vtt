<i>Streaming By ARCloud Api</i>

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.160
Whoa, look over there! That's Baek
Yoonho from the White Tiger Guild!

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.720
Choi Jong-in from the Hunters Guild, too!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.570
Look at all the press.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.830
What are they even here for?

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.150
Are the two of you here
to recruit Lee Minsung?

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.080
Minsung? Who are they talking about?

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.770
What's the likelihood that
he'll be retiring from acting?

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.500
I'm not here for him.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.500
Do you have any comment on his assessment?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.870
I understand that Mr. Minsung has
contracted with the Reaper Guild already,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.720
so this is a separate matter.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.010
Damn...

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.880
It would've spiced the story up.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.110
What a waste of time.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.760
I've heard the news.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.700
That A-Rank gate that nearly hit the
S-Rank threshold was real trouble, huh?

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.770
Nothing as serious as the red gate that
cost the White Tigers a rookie A-Rank.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.390
I heard you were on the verge
of giving us a call, though.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.600
He's the reason why that wasn't necessary.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.670
The Hunters Guild is prepared to give him
a very warm welcome as a show of gratitude.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.910
Don't be ridiculous! He saved our people,
too! And after a casualty, at that!

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.390
Do you really need more S-Ranks?
Are you looking to start a war?

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.090
I could say the same thing to you!

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.020
Hey, if it isn't Jong-in and Yoonho.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.790
You boys aren't here to try and
snatch Minsung from us, are you?

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.400
Like I said, I don't give a damn
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.400
I already said, I don't care
about Minsung or Min-<i>anyone</i>!

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.810
Damn, you guys are in sync.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.660
Uh, I'm here for my reassessment.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.470
What's going on?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.250
Check it out! It's
Minsung's press conference!

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.870
The actor?

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.410
He's supposed to be a total playboy.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.420
They call him the co-star killer.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.420
What are they talking about?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.220
Is he giving a public apology?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.220
Don't care.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.800
I'd like to thank you
all for gathering today.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.570
As you're all aware, I, Lee Minsung,
have awakened as a hunter.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.020
I'll be getting my rank assessed today.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.580
Since the day I awakened,
I've struggled with this decision.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.500
But now I've made up my mind!

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.950
To fulfill the destiny
that I've been born with!

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.330
I'll be fighting for Mr. Lim Tae-gyu,
the guild master of the Reaper Guild!

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.460
Are your acting days over?

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.390
Isn't this jumping the gun
before your assessment?

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.230
Will you be focusing on your hunter duties?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.630
How gullible can they get?
I've got my A-Rank already.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.090
My contract with the
Reapers is for two years.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.150
I'll dabble in hunting for that time,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.900
people will forget all about my scandals,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.680
and after? I'll be an
A-Rank hunter who acts.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.920
No matter what rank I receive, I'm prepared
to fight as a hunter with my life on the—

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.530
What do you think you're doing?!

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.420
Can't you see all these reporters?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.190
You're in the way! Buzz off!

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.660
Uh, I have business with the Association.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.900
It can wait!

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.280
Who is this oblivious idiot?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.450
This entrance is closed!
Now get out of here—

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.560
I'm afraid that isn't your call to make.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.160
Ch-Chairman Go!

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.460
This young man is a guest of mine.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.520
I seem to recall asking you to refrain from
holding a press conference at this hour.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.310
But... I'm trying to distract from my...

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.310
Right this way, Hunter Sung.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.770
What the hell do I do now?

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.730
I'll be right back! I just need to
confirm with the Association!

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.840
There's someone else being
reassessed at the moment.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.370
I'm afraid you can't enter
until it's complete.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.150
Dude, do you know who I am?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.310
One word from me,
and you'll be out on your—

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.120
I can't say I recognize you,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.210
but I don't appreciate
your lack of consideration.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.050
After hearing about today,
they came to await your results.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.790
I'm sure they're interested in the first
S-Rank hunter to appear in two years.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.510
Before we begin the reassessment,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.830
I'd like to confirm the nature
of your hunter abilities.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.700
What kind of powers do
you have, Hunter Sung?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.870
I can produce these.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.180
I... assume this is a summon?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.000
Then you have summoning magic.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.440
That... sounds right, sure.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.210
Hunter Sung.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.390
I've received a detailed account of
your abilities from Manager Woo.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.180
You're not going to
hold out on us, are you?

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.760
Yeah, I guess the cat's out
of the bag at this point.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.940
I can produce around a hundred more.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.830
A h-hundred?!

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.490
That's unbelievable!

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.280
His magic power is tremendous!

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.490
It's enough to overwhelm even me...

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.360
This is Hunter Sung's power?!

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.420
Thank you for your patience.
Your reassessment is now complete.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.190
This is your new hunter ID.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.670
Perfect. Now I can sell the Sphere of
Avarice without raising any eyebrows.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.420
That should cover the gear I need
to beat the Demon's Castle!

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.270
You are now officially an S-Rank hunter.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.770
I'm looking forward to seeing
what you do with that strength.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.240
Congratulations on your S-Rank assessment.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.440
Would you mind letting me thank you
for your help the other day?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.030
I've got something I'd like
to discuss with you, as well.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.550
If you could spare some of your time...

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.110
Sorry. I've actually got something
to attend to right now.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.300
Hang on, there's still—

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.170
Huh? What did he...

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.200
Uh, hey...

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.390
Hmm?

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.300
Hey. Hey, pay attention!

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.590
What?

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.900
That's Jinwoo—uh, your
brother on the stream.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.130
Huh?

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.910
No way! How?!

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.630
We've only just been able
to confirm this information.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.550
He really did make the news.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.370
I tried to tell you!
He's got a killer's eyes!

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.370
It's been one hour since
Chairman Go appeared,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.830
No telling what kind of
messed-up stuff he's done!

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.830
accompanying him to his reassessment...

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.750
and now Hunter Sung has been
officially named as S-Rank.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.140
The Association's
database has been updated,

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.500
and while there has been no announcement,
it seems his S-Rank status is confirmed.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.890
He is now

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.050
the 10th S-Rank hunter in the country—

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.020
the first to emerge in the
two years since Hunter Cha.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.060
An S-Rank?!

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.430
W-Wait—

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.440
He's the tenth S-Rank!

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.890
Hurry! Get after him!

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.790
But... my press conference...

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.900
Don't let him get away!

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.930
I wasn't able to get Mr. Sung
to accept the offer.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.950
I see.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.160
Sorry.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.170
There's still something I need
to take care of on my own.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.410
And to do that, I need to keep fighting
and get even stronger.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.720
Joining up with any organization
would only get in the way.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.300
Jinho.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.790
That's why...

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.810
He... also asked me to join him.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.190
And you realize how selfish that would be?

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.660
I had every intention of letting
Jinsung run this operation.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.070
You then came in,
and despite everything you said,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.100
instead of actually accomplishing anything,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.790
you intend on forsaking your
responsibilities to work elsewhere?

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.540
You can't be serious.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.000
Dad, I'm sorry.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.360
But I'm still going to work with Mr. Sung.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.900
Then you had best be prepared
for the consequences.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.220
Back away, please!

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.860
Please keep a reasonable distance!

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.450
Don't push! It's dangerous!

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.370
Don't wear yourself out dealing with them.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.290
We'll give you a lift home.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.330
It's okay.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.000
He's so physically gifted,
despite being a mage-type hunter...

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.820
President Baek?

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.430
So fast! Faster than I could see!

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.730
He's gotten even stronger since then.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.890
How is that possible?!

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.630
It's time to gear up.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.680
We've been waiting for you, Hunter Sung.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.850
You're looking for artifacts capable
of defending against flame, yes?

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.580
May I inquire the specifics?

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.510
I'm looking for protection
from a dungeon that's pretty hot.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.530
I see! In that case...

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.020
These may be what you're looking for.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.710
A cape that you can wear on top of your
clothes, and a ring that's easy to equip.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.100
Perfect!

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.220
And at these prices,
they should be well within your budget.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.180
I don't suppose... I can get a discount?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.550
I'm ever so sorry, sir, but the listed
prices are the only ones we offer.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:26.360
That said, if you can shatter this glass,
then you can have them free of charge.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.260
We happen to use glass
that is magically enhanced, you see.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.430
This glass? I can sense magic power,
but not that much...

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.870
Constructed as to not even budge
under blows from an A-Rank hunter.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:42.340
Across all the globe, you won't find
a display case of comparable security!

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.130
Wait, please! It was
only a joke, I'm afraid.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.620
Any unusual vibrations will summon security,
even if the glass isn't fully broken.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.290
Oh! I didn't realize. Sorry.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.430
No, I should be the one to apologize.
It was in most poor taste.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.920
Well.. uh... I was looking for some
other stuff, too. Like daggers.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.570
I'm in charge of weapons,
so please allow me.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.070
Right this way.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.320
But he hadn't even touched it...

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.930
How much for this one?

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.540
For that item, if you'll look here...

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.550
This little thing?

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.100
It's only about as strong
as Kasaka's Venom Fang.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.270
In that case...

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.090
Sir?

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.050
Where'd I put it...?

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.650
How much could I get for this?

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.560
Oh, this is impressive.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.120
I can sense an attention to detail
from the craftsman.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.230
It was just an item on sale in the store...

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.520
I believe it would sell for
no less than a hundred million.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.630
A hundred mill—?!

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.870
But it only cost 2.8 million gold.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.120
If the store's items can be
sold at these prices...

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.470
I might not even need to sell
the Sphere of Avarice.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.770
Could I use your bathroom?

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.150
Oh, sure.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.010
I knew he was strong.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.970
But what I saw... goes far beyond that.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.280
The magic power I could sense
from the assessment lab,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.310
and the athleticism he showed...

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.510
His reawakening should be long since past.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:25.020
And yet he's even stronger since then.
Is that even possible?

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.680
What if he's not a reawakened hunter...

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.850
but one capable of
getting stronger over time?

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.480
They're finally gone. Now I can head
to school without worrying...

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.500
You mean the press?

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.760
The Association must've chased them off.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.810
Uh, if you were gonna be on TV,
could you at least tell me,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.040
instead of making a huge scene
out of nowhere?!

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.100
Whoa, it wasn't <i>my</i> idea.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.180
Oh, by the way...

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.980
I'm gonna be out of the house
for about a week, starting tomorrow.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.550
Again? What now?

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.070
Could you people give it a—

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.820
Yoo Jinho, your trusty
sidekick, has arrived!

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.120
Huh. Is this a friend of yours?

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.230
You must be his sister!

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.310
I'm your brother's trusted
assistant, Yoo Jinho!

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.140
Starting tomorrow, we're gonna
be on a job for a week.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.430
Tomorrow? What are you—

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.710
We're gonna be on a job.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.210
Aren't we?

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.640
Y-Yep! Tomorrow's job is a big deal!
Painfully so...

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.980
They might be gone for now,
but given all the media coverage...

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.520
Come out.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.260
Huh? I thought Tusk had four bodyguards.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.570
Where's the other one?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.000
Right, I didn't get to extract his shadow
because he was smashed into the ceiling.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.230
Well, whatever. Strong as you are,
three of you should be plenty.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.690
You're in charge.
I need you to protect Jinah.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.690
Look after my sister for me.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.350
I should take a few more
precautions while I'm at it.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.250
Start your patrol.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.800
Might end up making the city
a little safer, come to think of it.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.980
Thanks for letting me stay the night.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.050
I don't mind, but what are you
gonna do going forward?

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.240
He didn't say you had to move out.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.840
It's my way of owning
up to the consequences.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.300
What's this job at the DS Tower, though?

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.830
You mentioned yesterday that you
wouldn't be coming home for a week.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.390
Well... Let's call it training.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.540
You wanna get even <i>stronger</i>?!
After earning an S-Rank?

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.070
I guess I do.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.770
Thanks. I'm heading out.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.860
Sure! Come back safe.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.780
A ring enchanted with water,
and a cape with wind...

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.990
That'll help me beat the heat.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.030
It's time I finished off
the Demon's Castle.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.960
Quest info?

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:30.860
"Collect Demon Souls 2."

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.500
I need to defeat the Demon Monarch,
Baran, and collect his soul.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.350
Rewards... A rune stone
for Shadow Exchange.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.430
That sounds like a job-exclusive skill!

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.260
That's a better reward than last time.
A nice bit of extra motivation.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.980
Let's head to the 75th
floor, where I left off.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.150
I never would've thought Jinho
would take off on his own.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.230
Do you miss him?

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.740
A troublesome child has
left the nest, that's all.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.200
Honestly, I'm surprised he
stuck around as long as—

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.750
That's strange...

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.830
Honey?

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.800
It's all dark...

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.250
Honey?!

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.230
Honey!

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.260
Time for a test drive.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.230
Come on out, Tusk.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.240
He blew it away?!
And that's after being nerfed?

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.720
Might have to think carefully
about how to use that move.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.640
For now, I'll have Tusk hold on
to the Sphere of Avarice.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.460
I see. Jinho came to visit, then?

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.790
Yes... I told him it was exhaustion.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.260
I'm sorry about this.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.220
Then it's... Eternal Sleep Disease?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:54.650
Yes. After periods of sudden drowsiness,
it leads to a persistent coma.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.940
How did I end up with such a disease?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.040
It tends to occur in people with
naturally low resistance to magic power

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.330
after prolonged exposure to it.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.500
Do you have any hunters
in your personal life?

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.430
Honey...

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.640
My son's a hunter.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.050
We can't be certain
that is the cause, but...

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.220
The entire world is permeated
with magic power these days.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.850
And I have no resistance.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.900
Am I being... culled?

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.710
Sure is peaceful, huh?

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.290
Sure is.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.110
You wanna go fishing after?

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.300
Aw, come on. We're still on patrol, y'know.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.200
What... is that?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.430
I formed six squads of shadows
for efficiency's sake.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.910
Looks like having them
split up has paid off.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.420
When I sent them out,
I gave them two orders:

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.390
Each team is to take down
any enemies they encounter,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.600
and if they find an entry permit,
they're to let me know.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.830
That means missing out on any other items,

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.290
but we're making much
faster progress in exchange.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.990
Or so I thought.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.360
But it's been two days since
we made it to the 80th floor,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.280
and the pace has slowed down a lot.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.760
Is there some reason?

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.120
The shadows are being destroyed.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.950
That's the high orc squad A.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.790
I didn't think any of the greater demons
would be a match for the high orcs.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.630
I'll recall them and go check it out.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.160
Squad B's down now, too.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.550
I don't know who did this,
but they must be pretty fierce.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.380
Something doesn't make sense, though.
Tusk's squad was right by squad A.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.900
So why was squad B, which was
further away, the next to go down?

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.570
Did they know they weren't
strong enough to beat Tusk?

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:10.590
If they target foes based on strength,
that implies a level of intelligence.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.480
And if that's the case,
the next target is likely...

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.760
Makes sense.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.180
No wonder the magic beast soldiers
couldn't handle them.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.820
I've been curious for a while now.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.500
Do magic beasts feel fear?

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.770
Guess I have my answer.
