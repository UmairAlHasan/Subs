00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:54.721
Have you heard about Mrs. Hazel?

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:56.790
Arrested on suspicion of being a spy.

00:00:56.814 --> 00:01:01.325
He said he leaked information about
Rogers Development Bank to Westalis.

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:05.345
If so, it certainly attracts attention.
State Security Agency.

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:09.345
Our beloved Ostania will not be afraid
with such threats.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.252
It looks like you've had too much to drink.

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.502
You should lie down for a while.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:26.849
Stay cool.
At most he's having fun too.

00:01:27.662 --> 00:01:31.793
We have also heard
regarding the scandal of President Bernard.

00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:33.014
Scandal?

00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:37.948
Can you tell me,
what is the scandal?

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:42.701
Of course, the night is still long.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:46.940
Please take a break for a while.

00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:12.770
I'm a little drunk.

00:02:13.256 --> 00:02:14.395
Are you alone?

00:02:14.673 --> 00:02:16.562
Now it's just the two of us.

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:20.383
Let's go, I want to eat.
the sweet ones.

00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:48.256
Good afternoon, or maybe good evening.

00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:50.998
The layout of the missile placement
I have got it.

00:02:51.227 --> 00:02:54.931
With this imbalance of power

<i>The man's name was Loid,

<i>A spy from
Westalis Intelligence Department.</i>

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:06.999
Of course, I have completed the mission.
perfectly.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.492
Kill him!
Our opponent is only one!

00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:22.719
Who are you?!
Who exactly are you, you bastard?!

00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:28.757
Is it true that you are Manager Cassado?
from Surfoka Aviation Industry?

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:32.534
I heard you are
trash traitors to the country...

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.231
...who sold weapons to Westalis.

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:38.614
I apologize profusely...

00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:42.257
But may I stop your breath?

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.306
<i>The woman's name is Yor.</i>

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:56.339
<i>In that world, he is a brilliant assassin.
who is called Thorn Princess.</i>

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:07.249
<i>Spy and assassin
which are equally brilliant.</i>

00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:09.043
<i>They both...</i>

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.255
Ah, welcome, Yor.

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.356
Thank you also for your work
at the Hospital, Loid.

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:17.889
<i>...are a married couple.</i>

00:04:18.264 --> 00:04:21.204
<i>- However, it was a fake marriage...</i>
- You look tired, Yor.

00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:23.159
<i>- ...for the sake of her husband's mission...</i>
- Many guests attended.

00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:24.003
<i>- ...and cover up the wife's identity.</i>
- Visitor?

00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:25.310
<i>- ...and cover up the wife's identity.</i>
- Ah, like this...

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:27.500
<i>- They don't know each other either...</i>
- Because I'm on guard for public service.

00:04:27.524 --> 00:04:30.253
<i>- ...each other's true identity.</i>
- Wow, civil servants always work hard too, huh.

00:04:30.277 --> 00:04:32.637
Welcome, Dad, Mom!

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:36.883
<i>The girl's name is Anya.
An orphan adopted for a mission.</i>

00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:39.290
<i>- He also has a secret.</i>
- We're home, Anya.

00:04:39.592 --> 00:04:41.183
Have you been a good boy?

00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:46.065
<i>Hidden camera movies
I have to process it before tomorrow morning.</i>

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:50.325
<i>Hidden camera?!
Cool spy!</i>

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:51.600
<i>Exciting!</i>

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.227
<i>He is a mind reading esper.</i>

00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:58.230
<i>Phew, thank goodness I can go home
before dinner.</i>

00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:03.649
<i>Today I was pelted with grenades and
shot at by anti-tank rockets, very tired.</i>

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.264
<i>Big fight before dinner?!</i>

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:11.520
You must be hungry,
How about I make you an omelet tonight?

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:16.803
<i>The dog's name is Bond,
this family pet.</i>

00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:29.656
<i>And is a test animal
who can predict the future.</i>

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:33.117
<i>If you let Mom cook,
it will be a family disaster!</i>

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.157
Anya wants to have dinner
That's just what Dad made.

00:05:37.377 --> 00:05:40.497
That one?
You mean peanut cream pizza?

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:41.593
Yes, that one!

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.278
That's also okay.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.576
Okay, tonight will be
I added meat on top.

00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:49.922
Meat, meat, hooray!

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.956
Cooking class?

00:06:04.044 --> 00:06:06.074
That's right, Anya Forger.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.303
Snack making class
is our school tradition.

00:06:09.694 --> 00:06:12.196
Damn, what do you know?

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.865
What a natural shrimp brain.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.557
What's wrong with that?

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.723
The important thing is to be able to make it
delicious snack, right?

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:21.795
Anya likes snacks.

00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:25.919
Not eaten, but made.
Do you understand?

00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:29.159
At most he can only make
commoner's snack.

00:06:29.537 --> 00:06:34.023
Stupid, how can he do that?
food that humans can eat?

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.457
That's right, Mr. Damian.

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:38.155
Exactly right.

00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.493
The second son is rude.

00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:41.199
Not elegant.

00:06:43.334 --> 00:06:45.046
Stop talking.

00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:47.554
Scolded, it was the second son's fault.

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.540
Shut up! You...

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:56.642
This year the principal
who will assess directly.

00:06:56.932 --> 00:06:59.885
Last year's winner gets a Stella.

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.260
Stella...

00:07:04.118 --> 00:07:05.764
<i>At the prestigious Eden Academy,</i>

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.983
<i>students who excel...</i>

00:07:08.086 --> 00:07:11.129
<i>...will get an award
named Stella.</i>

00:07:11.548 --> 00:07:14.113
<i>Students who can collect 8 Stella...</i>

00:07:14.148 --> 00:07:18.173
<i>...will be allowed to attend the event
a social gathering place for the elite.</i>

00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:23.165
<i>Operation Strix
which was handed over to Twilight.</i>

00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:25.432
<i>Is entering the event...</i>

00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:31.819
<i>...and approached Donovan Desmond,
important Ostanian politicians were present there.</i>

00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:35.517
<i>That's why
he created a fake family...</i>

00:07:35.596 --> 00:07:38.623
<i>...and send his daughter to school,
Anya is there.</i>

00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:43.833
Classes are held on Mondays at 2:00 p.m.
You can make any snack.

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:48.385
Prepare everything carefully,
and cook elegantly.

00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:51.321
Monday at 14.00.

00:07:51.815 --> 00:07:54.420
That means you have to practice cooking
on the weekend.

00:08:00.878 --> 00:08:02.590
Password F?

00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:32.403
Good afternoon,
or maybe good night, Agent Twilight.

00:08:32.983 --> 00:08:35.305
What's up this time, Handler?

00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:38.812
I want you to do
new infiltration task.

00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:47.970
There is not enough time
for a task of this magnitude.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.446
I'm busy with Operation Strix.

00:08:50.723 --> 00:08:52.273
Just forget about it.

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.374
That's Major Depple
from the Army Intelligence Agency.

00:08:58.631 --> 00:09:01.100
He will be the one to continue Operation Strix.

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:06.160
He is an incompetent man.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.473
Desmond is a cautious man.

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:13.086
Depple's skills and experience
not enough for this mission.

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:14.907
The risks are too great.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.646
I think so too.

00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:19.613
But this is the decision of the central headquarters.

00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:23.346
Depple has supporters
from important people on the committee.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.159
The top brass couldn't refuse
in order to get a budget.

00:09:29.453 --> 00:09:32.705
If only we had
little development,

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:35.472
can be used as material to refute.

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:47.126
<i>How do they know the situation on the ground?</i>

00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:51.644
<i>How critical stability is
between East and West.</i>

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.511
Please.

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:03.832
Thank You.

00:10:15.192 --> 00:10:18.106
He thought he wouldn't get caught cheating.

00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:19.353
That's right.

00:10:33.773 --> 00:10:34.944
Please.

00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:40.046
WHY IS SENIOR TWILIGHT HERE?
Thank you very much, Mr. Kind.

00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:42.239
HOW IS OPERATION STRIX PROGRESSING?
How should I thank you?

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:46.505
BETWEEN AGENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED
No need to think about it.

00:10:46.617 --> 00:10:48.025
DIGGING UP EACH OTHER'S MISSIONS, NIGHTFALL.
Your hat is very beautiful.

00:10:48.308 --> 00:10:51.719
<i>By separating the pronunciation
and the shape of their mouths,</i>

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.598
<i>spies can talk
without being suspected by others.</i>

00:10:54.763 --> 00:10:56.604
AS I SAID BEFORE
This is an imported item,

00:10:56.721 --> 00:10:58.896
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE A FAKE FAMILY WITH AMATEURS
I pay close attention to the ingredients.

00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:01.669
Because this is a rare item
which is hard to get,

00:11:01.867 --> 00:11:04.349
I BETTER REPLACE HIS WIFE'S ROLE NOW
I got it from a colleague.

00:11:08.693 --> 00:11:09.972
Loid?

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.519
He just k-kissed with a woman?!

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:18.865
Brother Yor, did you hear that?

00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:21.152
Oh yes?

00:11:25.987 --> 00:11:27.813
What were we talking about?

00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:30.936
About cheating.

00:11:30.992 --> 00:11:32.023
Have an affair?

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:38.799
Cheating has 3 signs.
One, often out of town.

00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:41.279
It's even more suspicious if you stay overnight.

00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:43.739
Two, her taste in clothes changed.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.439
To match with his mistress.

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:48.906
Three, sudden gifts.

00:11:48.964 --> 00:11:51.018
It must be because I feel guilty.

00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:52.298
Easy to guess.

00:11:56.427 --> 00:11:59.429
Is that true?

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.882
That's right.

00:12:01.018 --> 00:12:04.910
All my friends are divorced
said exactly that.

00:12:20.187 --> 00:12:22.470
<i>Released from Operation Strix.</i>

00:12:23.164 --> 00:12:26.650
<i>That means I have to get out of here.</i>

00:12:30.163 --> 00:12:32.396
<i>Who do you think that woman is?</i>

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:34.289
<i>Loid's lover?</i>

00:12:34.772 --> 00:12:39.383
<i>If that's true, why are you asking me?
to be his wife?</i>

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:45.411
<i>Don't tell me you want to replace me
as Mother Anya with someone else?</i>

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:50.852
<i>Am I really that incompetent?
become a wife and mother?!</i>

00:12:50.877 --> 00:12:52.612
Anya is back!

00:12:53.655 --> 00:12:56.658
I got a special mission file from school.

00:12:56.941 --> 00:12:58.482
Cooking class?

00:12:58.732 --> 00:13:01.710
Friends will make snacks
to get first place.

00:13:02.143 --> 00:13:05.009
Eh, there is a class like that apparently.

00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:13.436
<i>If you can get Stella here,
could be the progress of Operation Strix.</i>

00:13:14.123 --> 00:13:17.153
<i>Handler can object
Headquarters with it.</i>

00:13:17.191 --> 00:13:21.826
Becky wants to make some kind of cake,
The second son said something like that.

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:25.903
<i>This year the judges are the school principals.</i>

00:13:26.326 --> 00:13:30.042
<i>If I'm not mistaken there is a file
about his favorite food...</i>

00:13:35.852 --> 00:13:37.348
How about making a memere?

00:13:39.091 --> 00:13:40.368
Remember?

00:13:40.543 --> 00:13:42.716
He said it was the principal's favorite.

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:45.015
That's great to know.

00:13:45.586 --> 00:13:48.588
I saw it in a school newspaper article.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:52.902
Meremere from Phrygis,
His hometown is said to be the nicest.

00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:56.055
Anya wants to try eating it!

00:13:56.149 --> 00:13:59.895
But it's an old snack, rarely available here.

00:14:00.378 --> 00:14:05.388
<i>According to the files, there is a restaurant in Frigis
which sells unique meremere.</i>

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.947
How about we go to Frigis?

00:14:09.214 --> 00:14:12.733
If you are aiming for first place,
better try the original one.

00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:20.443
It's a bit far if you go on the weekend.
there will still be time.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.223
Want to!

00:14:25.351 --> 00:14:26.813
Want to stay overnight?

00:14:27.581 --> 00:14:30.202
One, often out of town.

00:14:30.332 --> 00:14:32.672
<i>Does this count as out of town?</i>

00:14:32.825 --> 00:14:35.045
<i>Sign of cheating? But...</i>

00:14:35.088 --> 00:14:38.385
Snacks! Snacks!

00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:43.099
We're not going to go fooling around, understand?

00:14:44.472 --> 00:14:45.399
Execute.

00:14:45.498 --> 00:14:49.457
Legendary Meremere
I will definitely get it. Cring!

00:14:49.664 --> 00:14:52.318
Not legendary,
can be purchased at the restaurant.

00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:55.250
What's your weekend plan, Yor?

00:14:55.314 --> 00:14:56.696
Hey, am I coming too?

00:14:57.159 --> 00:15:02.613
<i>I heard that the restaurant has a rule.
can only be entered by complete families.</i>

00:15:02.925 --> 00:15:05.659
<i>If I come too,</i>

00:15:05.882 --> 00:15:08.464
<i>does this mean it's not a sign?</i>

00:15:08.714 --> 00:15:10.191
Do you have an agenda?

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.260
N-No, I'm empty.

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.846
Good then.

00:15:14.537 --> 00:15:16.790
Let's go to Phrygis.

00:15:16.947 --> 00:15:18.993
- Good!
- Hooray!

00:16:48.513 --> 00:16:50.591
Anya hates studying.

00:16:50.922 --> 00:16:53.424
You've just been taught, right?

00:16:53.575 --> 00:16:57.118
<i>In order to get Stella, the basic ability
academics must be improved.</i>

00:16:57.512 --> 00:16:59.191
Dad, I want to go to the toilet.

00:17:00.315 --> 00:17:01.867
Can you go alone?

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.198
Can!

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:04.911
Base.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.404
What's this?

00:17:31.912 --> 00:17:36.023
The coveted treasure
by Republicans.

00:17:36.084 --> 00:17:37.491
As long as you have that...

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.377
Treasure?

00:17:40.501 --> 00:17:42.504
Is this the key to the treasure?

00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:52.186
Exciting!

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.533
The writing should be readable, of course.

00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:02.159
Not long ago I accompanied him
learn to write.

00:18:02.306 --> 00:18:04.608
Anya has tried hard.

00:18:04.766 --> 00:18:08.546
It's been a long time, hopefully I don't get lost on the way.

00:18:09.124 --> 00:18:11.817
Yor is used to it
be a mother now.

00:18:12.403 --> 00:18:14.234
Ah, not really.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:19.277
<i>Eh, I think Loid is not satisfied
with my mother's role?</i>

00:18:19.634 --> 00:18:22.477
<i>Maybe, he is not satisfied
with the role of my wife?!</i>

00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:24.733
Yor?

00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:29.252
<i>It's true that I have a lot
shortcomings as a wife.</i>

00:18:35.426 --> 00:18:37.074
What's wrong with your lips?

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:41.579
My-My lipstick doesn't seem to match,
so it's a bit itchy.

00:18:41.713 --> 00:18:44.802
Besides that, Anya took a long time too.

00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:47.406
I'm worried, let me take a look.

00:18:52.116 --> 00:18:54.633
<i>Our status as a married couple is just a cover.</i>

00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:58.160
<i>Loid should understand that too.</i>

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.154
What I saw earlier was number 8.

00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:13.407
This is the place I saw earlier!

00:19:19.706 --> 00:19:21.127
Treasure!

00:19:26.476 --> 00:19:30.791
<i>Wait, Anya.
It's not good to open other people's things.</i>

00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:33.871
The coveted treasure
by Republicans.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:39.596
<i>In fact, it could be the contents
can endanger world peace.</i>

00:19:41.938 --> 00:19:45.265
<i>This is a patrol for world peace!</i>

00:20:06.423 --> 00:20:07.574
Chocolate?

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:10.467
It turns out it's not a secret item.

00:20:12.035 --> 00:20:14.221
You stupid.

00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:27.253
Yummy, yummy.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:31.028
Luca, you could be killed by the Colonel,
if the key is lost.

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:36.885
As my horoscope says,
must be careful of losing things.

00:20:37.485 --> 00:20:41.463
What I know,
there is in the suitcase with a ship sticker.

00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:43.505
Just pry it off and it's done.

00:20:46.557 --> 00:20:48.188
What does this mean?

00:20:59.707 --> 00:21:02.960
6... 7... 8...

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.600
From the number, it should be here.

00:21:06.987 --> 00:21:08.787
Is that true?

00:21:08.993 --> 00:21:12.439
Our agent
It took a lot of trouble to steal it, you know.

00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:15.812
They said it took 3 years to infiltrate
in a Western research lab?

00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:18.018
Wow, that's heavy.

00:21:18.238 --> 00:21:21.973
Because this is the treasure that is desired
Republicans.

00:21:22.078 --> 00:21:25.886
As long as there is that, East-West balance
can be turned around in one moment.

00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:33.590
We finally made it
creating the best chocolate in Westalis!

00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:43.870
I am a subordinate of
Count Hands from the Throat!

00:21:43.895 --> 00:21:45.975
The best chocolate is mine!

00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:50.150
Hereby our country's chocolate
will be more delicious and sell well!

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:54.813
No! The Western chocolate industry is over!

00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:59.301
<i>A gang of pickpockets targeting chocolate?
They are bad people?</i>

00:21:59.628 --> 00:22:02.908
Here it is, a suitcase with stickers.

00:22:06.175 --> 00:22:07.807
It's opened...

00:22:12.812 --> 00:22:15.201
Hey, it's empty inside!

00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:20.578
Domitri, this is the key I dropped.

00:22:20.658 --> 00:22:24.125
So someone picked up the key
and take its contents.

00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:25.365
Who is that?

00:22:25.412 --> 00:22:26.812
How would I know?

00:22:26.925 --> 00:22:28.854
What do you want now?

00:22:28.979 --> 00:22:31.518
We'll find the person and take him back.

00:22:31.672 --> 00:22:34.861
Then, so as not to be caught,

00:22:35.962 --> 00:22:37.031
we kill him.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.032
<i>Killed?!</i>

00:22:43.145 --> 00:22:43.823
Who's that?!

00:22:44.023 --> 00:22:44.903
Come on out!

00:22:45.016 --> 00:22:48.010
My flower forecast
already know you're hiding.

00:22:50.488 --> 00:22:51.395
We'll chase him.

00:22:59.767 --> 00:23:00.872
Small child?

00:23:01.232 --> 00:23:03.073
The kid who ate it?

00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:05.172
It's dangerous if there are eye witnesses,

00:23:05.249 --> 00:23:07.037
So I locked the door.

00:23:07.062 --> 00:23:09.700
Father mother!

00:23:10.284 --> 00:23:14.297
It's useless. Even though it sounds,
the door won't open.

00:23:20.211 --> 00:23:21.251
Mom!

00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:22.390
Anya?!

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.886
Who are they?

00:23:25.951 --> 00:23:27.875
Uh, uh...

00:23:28.088 --> 00:23:31.205
You are this child's mother?
He has eaten...

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.141
Chocolate thieves! They are bad guys!

00:23:34.803 --> 00:23:37.141
Anya is about to be harmed.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.980
Tch, what a bother.

00:23:41.078 --> 00:23:43.220
Let's just arrest them both.

00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:49.533
Well, Mom...

00:23:49.601 --> 00:23:52.720
Anya, please close your eyes.

00:23:57.522 --> 00:23:59.927
It's safe now, Anya.

00:24:00.219 --> 00:24:03.454
Um... They both...

00:24:03.495 --> 00:24:05.373
Just fell over.

00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:10.888
<i>Anya just now
stop the ambitions of evil people?</i>

00:24:24.793 --> 00:24:26.688
Wow!

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.795
Wow!

00:24:48.414 --> 00:24:52.208
Let's go. Let's finish the objective first.

00:24:52.361 --> 00:24:56.761
T-That's true.
Let's go, Anya, Bond.

00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:05.461
What are you guys doing?!

00:25:05.548 --> 00:25:07.861
Report to the Colonel.

00:25:08.683 --> 00:25:13.254
RUBBER AND BONDS RESTAURANT

00:25:24.284 --> 00:25:25.747
Please place your order.

00:25:26.216 --> 00:25:27.460
Delicious.

00:25:27.524 --> 00:25:28.727
Wipe his mouth first.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.936
Rubble and Bonds Resto,
Is this the restaurant we were looking for?

00:25:37.003 --> 00:25:40.664
That's right and they only serve
family group.

00:25:40.712 --> 00:25:42.136
Exciting!

00:25:44.275 --> 00:25:47.463
Sorry, Bond.
Pets are not allowed.

00:25:52.933 --> 00:25:54.531
Ready to order?

00:25:54.968 --> 00:25:59.932
We ordered lunch packages today
plus meat pie and smoked salmon.

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:01.685
Just stir-fried chicken, do you want some?

00:26:01.718 --> 00:26:03.565
Want to eat that!

00:26:03.905 --> 00:26:06.904
Then, at the same time, cover it with a lid.

00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:11.034
You guys are lucky.
It just so happens that there is only one left.

00:26:11.094 --> 00:26:13.271
Really? Thank goodness then.

00:26:19.291 --> 00:26:21.687
- Enjoy your meal!
- Enjoy your meal!

00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:35.084
This is our special menu.

00:26:44.943 --> 00:26:47.279
Please stir-fry chicken with peanut sauce.

00:26:47.382 --> 00:26:48.496
Looks delicious!

00:26:48.616 --> 00:26:52.918
Don't use your hands.
The etiquette is to use a knife and fork.

00:26:53.025 --> 00:26:53.863
Oops!

00:27:01.391 --> 00:27:04.790
<i>It's amazing that Loid wears a turtle collar.</i>

00:27:05.298 --> 00:27:07.804
Two, her taste in clothes changed.

00:27:08.197 --> 00:27:10.212
<i>Eh?! Could it be that this is...</i>

00:27:10.323 --> 00:27:12.167
<i>One of the signs?!</i>

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.136
<i>Even though it's cold here,
I think my clothes are too thick.</i>

00:27:15.317 --> 00:27:17.550
<i>So it's true?</i>

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.583
<i>I have to ask about that woman.</i>

00:27:20.843 --> 00:27:24.768
<i>If Loid really has a girlfriend,
I will...</i>

00:27:25.167 --> 00:27:26.579
Is there something wrong?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.791
No, there isn't any.

00:27:28.854 --> 00:27:31.427
<i>I'll just ask when Anya isn't around.</i>

00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:34.674
Welcome to the Resto Puing and Ikatan.

00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:37.934
How does the dish taste?

00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:41.720
Awesome. Very delicious.
Call the chef.

00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:44.099
I am the chef.

00:27:44.235 --> 00:27:47.169
Rubble and Bonds, what a unique name.

00:27:47.481 --> 00:27:51.161
You've seen the military aircraft
which is displayed at the station, right?

00:27:51.267 --> 00:27:51.921
Yes

00:27:52.016 --> 00:27:55.047
It was a plane of two accomplished pilots,

00:27:55.161 --> 00:27:57.687
Recky and Brandon during the war.

00:27:58.601 --> 00:28:02.726
Phrygitis used to be
harsh air combat terrain.

00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:04.947
Phrygic?!

00:28:06.174 --> 00:28:08.918
Did you just say Phrygitis?

00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:11.312
The location of the air force base...

00:28:11.466 --> 00:28:16.452
Yes, although it is not clear,
but the Intelligence Agency is investigating it.

00:28:17.101 --> 00:28:19.483
Yuri Briar, permission to take leave.

00:28:19.972 --> 00:28:22.561
Hey, wait, what's going on?

00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:26.782
My brother is on holiday in Frigis.

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:30.134
My brother could even get lost
in his own city.

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.191
What if you get involved in a case...

00:28:32.294 --> 00:28:34.966
Wait a minute, the information is not clear yet.

00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:36.838
Let me investigate.

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:39.258
We are Security Agency Officers, you know.

00:28:39.477 --> 00:28:42.558
Don't just interfere in military affairs.

00:28:46.979 --> 00:28:49.732
Older brother!

00:28:50.719 --> 00:28:55.527
I lost everything
as a result of relentless air attacks.

00:28:55.628 --> 00:28:59.136
My home, my family.
Even eating is difficult.

00:28:59.318 --> 00:29:02.537
Sleeping in a roofed place is also not possible.

00:29:03.384 --> 00:29:07.228
At that time, there was a small child
who approached me.

00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:11.157
He asked for help to take it
food from under the rubble.

00:29:11.697 --> 00:29:15.970
The child is an orphan,
same as me.

00:29:16.628 --> 00:29:20.643
<i>So that hell does not happen again,</i>

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:22.836
<i>I became a spy.</i>

00:29:23.503 --> 00:29:26.638
The warmth at the dinner table that has disappeared,

00:29:26.749 --> 00:29:30.101
and the taste of home made by mother,

00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:33.469
I want all customers
can enjoy it.

00:29:33.975 --> 00:29:38.443
Just consider it personal satisfaction
to entertain my old self.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.702
Please, this is what we've been waiting for.

00:29:52.277 --> 00:29:53.468
Here he is?

00:29:53.506 --> 00:29:56.339
It's a bit unique indeed.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.943
<i>It's the Special Reconnaissance Regiment
Military Intelligence Agency.</i>

00:30:01.028 --> 00:30:02.817
Why is it here?

00:30:04.609 --> 00:30:06.940
It smells delicious.

00:30:07.203 --> 00:30:09.536
This is the right restaurant.

00:30:09.743 --> 00:30:14.289
Sorry sir, our restaurant
only serves family groups.

00:30:14.344 --> 00:30:17.426
Bring me lamb pastry
and cod pilaf.

00:30:17.462 --> 00:30:19.556
I also ask for mercy.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.043
But, sorry...

00:30:21.242 --> 00:30:24.995
I'm sorry sir,
we ran out of meremere today.

00:30:25.102 --> 00:30:26.639
What?

00:30:28.441 --> 00:30:30.360
Then what is it?

00:30:31.235 --> 00:30:33.519
That was the last one.

00:30:33.604 --> 00:30:36.266
It doesn't seem to have been touched.

00:30:37.926 --> 00:30:43.165
I beg you, even though you are a soldier
please obey the rules.

00:30:43.491 --> 00:30:48.178
Military forces have the right to regulate
food supply in the defense area.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.243
I can also close this restaurant.

00:30:51.505 --> 00:30:53.377
Oh Lord...

00:30:54.298 --> 00:30:55.611
Excuse me.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.170
Thank you for your hard work.

00:30:58.411 --> 00:31:03.404
My daughter is looking forward to this meremere,
Can I please choose another dish?

00:31:03.692 --> 00:31:06.884
Tourists? Come here just for fun?

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.597
Correct.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.370
Travel for delicious food.

00:31:10.458 --> 00:31:12.852
Interesting, I think I'm a good match for you.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:13.442
In that case...

00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:16.556
Our tastes are the same,
how about just competing?

00:31:17.256 --> 00:31:22.229
If you win,
I will hand over this to you, how about it?

00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:34.802
Guess the type of sugar
which is used in all these dishes.

00:31:35.016 --> 00:31:38.167
Write your answer here.

00:31:39.835 --> 00:31:42.141
Please answer in as much detail as possible.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.494
If our answers are the same?

00:31:44.582 --> 00:31:47.585
I'll let you win then.

00:31:50.272 --> 00:31:52.160
Okay, please start.

00:31:57.608 --> 00:32:00.960
This whiskey cake is baked
perfectly.

00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:02.341
I give it a score of 85.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.780
<i>He looked down on me as a common tourist.</i>

00:32:05.037 --> 00:32:08.751
<i>I once infiltrated as a chef
in a five star restaurant.</i>

00:32:09.112 --> 00:32:11.484
<i>I will win this match.</i>

00:32:19.282 --> 00:32:21.915
Show your answer.

00:32:26.109 --> 00:32:27.375
From left...

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.024
Palm sugar, white granulated sugar...

00:32:30.274 --> 00:32:31.561
...and powdered sugar.

00:32:31.766 --> 00:32:33.767
R-Right.

00:32:33.935 --> 00:32:35.348
Wow, that's great.

00:32:35.391 --> 00:32:37.408
Daddy is a sugar expert!

00:32:38.975 --> 00:32:41.186
You may too.

00:32:41.264 --> 00:32:43.334
Now it's my turn.

00:32:48.027 --> 00:32:49.768
Even know the gram measurement?!

00:32:50.604 --> 00:32:51.684
How?

00:32:52.081 --> 00:32:53.577
Ex-Exactly.

00:32:54.344 --> 00:32:58.388
My answer is more detailed.

00:33:02.364 --> 00:33:04.737
Dad lost.

00:33:04.778 --> 00:33:06.030
Oh no.

00:33:16.416 --> 00:33:20.921
I'm satisfied, especially the reminder.
remarkable.

00:33:22.758 --> 00:33:24.433
Thank you very much.

00:33:27.212 --> 00:33:28.320
Father.

00:33:28.787 --> 00:33:32.681
Take it easy, Anya.
Let's eat the meremere tomorrow.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.844
Just take the train,
won't be late for cooking class.

00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:37.209
Well...

00:33:37.747 --> 00:33:42.000
Ingredients for kneading,
can only come on Monday.

00:33:42.077 --> 00:33:46.330
Is it true?!
Can I have the recipe?

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.027
The recipe is not written.

00:33:49.157 --> 00:33:52.450
Even if there was, I couldn't tell you.

00:33:52.574 --> 00:33:53.369
Stingy.

00:33:53.777 --> 00:33:54.617
Hush.

00:33:54.687 --> 00:33:57.583
How about making another snack?

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:03.784
<i>Anya can't win in the usual way.</i>

00:34:04.162 --> 00:34:08.584
<i>The only opportunity that exists is</i>
they are the principal's favorite.

00:34:09.015 --> 00:34:11.770
<i>I've lost my hope of getting Stella.</i>

00:34:17.144 --> 00:34:22.280
If we buy the ingredients ourselves,
would you mind making one?

00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:23.824
Yes of course.

00:34:24.089 --> 00:34:25.040
Yor.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.904
It's too early to give up.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:36.871
This is the ingredient the chef told me about earlier.

00:34:37.125 --> 00:34:38.865
There are many too.

00:34:38.971 --> 00:34:40.172
Does not matter.

00:34:41.147 --> 00:34:43.398
<i>Dried cherries in the front right shop.</i>

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:45.511
<i>Behind it are lingonberries.</i>

00:34:45.947 --> 00:34:49.092
<i>On the back shelf of the shop, third from the right
there are hazelnuts.</i>

00:34:50.299 --> 00:34:51.511
<i>Got it all.</i>

00:34:51.738 --> 00:34:53.366
Wait a moment.

00:35:16.417 --> 00:35:18.418
Next is the orange syrup.

00:35:18.486 --> 00:35:21.136
Buy one for his wife, Bro?

00:35:21.929 --> 00:35:26.624
Moisturizing lipstick that is gentle on the skin
made from genuine Frigis honey.

00:35:26.671 --> 00:35:28.171
Wife...

00:35:28.262 --> 00:35:30.087
I'll buy one then.

00:35:30.136 --> 00:35:33.143
Loid, I don't need it.

00:35:33.324 --> 00:35:35.742
You said your lipstick doesn't match, right?

00:35:38.052 --> 00:35:39.516
What color is this?

00:35:42.748 --> 00:35:45.980
That is true.
The color is nice.

00:35:48.963 --> 00:35:50.194
Thank You.

00:35:52.203 --> 00:35:53.101
Please.

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.627
A-Is this...

00:35:56.775 --> 00:35:59.326
Three, sudden gifts.

00:36:01.102 --> 00:36:03.565
...a gift for me?

00:36:05.053 --> 00:36:05.933
Of course.

00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:09.732
<i>Lately he seems gloomy.</i>

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:13.154
<i>Caring for your partner is also part of the mission.</i>

00:36:13.744 --> 00:36:17.441
<i>The three signs of cheating have been collected.</i>

00:36:19.791 --> 00:36:20.720
Yor?

00:36:20.805 --> 00:36:22.550
Um, I...

00:36:22.767 --> 00:36:25.229
...want to go to the toilet for a moment.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.891
Yes.

00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:32.123
<i>Tired of the journey?</i>

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:34.144
<i>Is Yor okay?</i>

00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:35.310
Father!

00:36:37.966 --> 00:36:39.427
What is that?!

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:49.450
Sparkling sparkles!

00:36:49.475 --> 00:36:51.342
Oh, the supermarket, huh.

00:36:51.457 --> 00:36:53.619
- Sparkle!
- Wait, wait, wait!

00:37:00.374 --> 00:37:03.180
Don't just hang around like that,
you'll get lost later.

00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:07.369
If you find the orange syrup,
I will accompany you around.

00:37:07.417 --> 00:37:12.252
Dare to try to get a snack,
locally made snacks or orange syrup?

00:37:12.666 --> 00:37:14.321
Orange syrup!

00:37:14.387 --> 00:37:15.469
Are you serious?!

00:37:19.192 --> 00:37:21.153
It didn't fall at all.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.864
What a waste.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.470
Uncle, one more time!

00:37:30.977 --> 00:37:33.851
Uncle, I want one.

00:37:39.903 --> 00:37:42.364
Go to hell, honey!

00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:50.366
They are so tough.

00:37:50.631 --> 00:37:52.493
Not even moving.

00:37:58.468 --> 00:38:00.893
Damn, it's already hit!

00:38:01.699 --> 00:38:04.151
<i>It's a waste.</i>

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.253
<i>No matter how many times, it won't fall.</i>

00:38:07.483 --> 00:38:12.368
<i>Apart from the bottom shelf, everything is on hold.
so it doesn't fall.</i>

00:38:14.217 --> 00:38:16.416
<i>He's an evil gunman!</i>

00:38:16.519 --> 00:38:20.864
<i>So that's it, a common trick.
used in similar kiosks.</i>

00:38:27.317 --> 00:38:28.751
I also want to.

00:38:35.893 --> 00:38:38.109
<i>Aiming for orange syrup apparently.</i>

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.823
<i>Just try it, it will definitely be mental.</i>

00:38:49.688 --> 00:38:50.713
What's that?

00:38:51.327 --> 00:38:53.427
Win big!

00:38:53.745 --> 00:38:56.694
Wow, you are very lucky, sir.

00:38:56.733 --> 00:38:58.293
Great, great!

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.007
This is not luck.

00:39:00.957 --> 00:39:03.710
Do I need to repeat it again?

00:39:05.527 --> 00:39:08.947
When selling, it's best to be honest.

00:39:10.189 --> 00:39:11.851
Good.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:15.969
Fall too!
Suddenly it became this easy.

00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:18.722
That means we only need one more ingredient.

00:39:18.947 --> 00:39:21.169
Anya, we'll take the tram later...

00:39:22.729 --> 00:39:25.143
Dad, Dad!

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.043
Hey!

00:39:31.203 --> 00:39:32.575
Damn, he's...

00:39:42.254 --> 00:39:44.907
<i>If you consider Loid's happiness,</i>

00:39:45.712 --> 00:39:48.795
<i>should I just back off?</i>

00:39:49.465 --> 00:39:53.100
<i>Loid and I are just a fake couple.</i>

00:39:53.232 --> 00:39:55.379
Dad, turn around!

00:39:55.446 --> 00:39:57.256
Yeah, I know.

00:39:57.405 --> 00:40:02.319
<i>What's the fun of riding a vehicle?
which just goes around in circles?</i>

00:40:02.815 --> 00:40:04.352
<i>Children cause misunderstanding.</i>

00:40:07.179 --> 00:40:10.312
The lipstick matches too.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.952
Thank you very much.

00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:17.125
Would you like something to drink?
Hot coffee for example.

00:40:19.279 --> 00:40:22.125
<i>I'll have to ask Loid.</i>

00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:23.631
But...

00:40:23.835 --> 00:40:25.031
What would you like to order?

00:40:25.519 --> 00:40:28.571
I'll just have coffee, what do you want, Yor?

00:40:32.674 --> 00:40:34.060
What, Yor?

00:40:36.327 --> 00:40:40.214
<i>Without relying on the power of alcohol,
I wouldn't dare ask!</i>

00:40:46.542 --> 00:40:48.173
Wait, Yor?

00:40:48.614 --> 00:40:50.079
If it's that much...

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.282
Yor, are you okay?

00:41:04.401 --> 00:41:07.821
Loid, you have a lover, right!

00:41:08.774 --> 00:41:12.308
Is that right? Answer it!

00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:13.701
Yor, you drank too much.

00:41:17.598 --> 00:41:19.955
Are Mom and Dad being affectionate?

00:41:26.721 --> 00:41:29.922
Loid, come on answer me.

00:41:30.458 --> 00:41:33.002
Am I...

00:41:43.105 --> 00:41:44.449
Are you alright?

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.082
Mom is stoned.

00:41:46.196 --> 00:41:50.382
Sorry, I'm so stupid...

00:41:53.051 --> 00:41:57.661
<i>I went too far, Loid will be angry.</i>

00:41:57.845 --> 00:42:00.951
<i>If it's like this, we'll definitely get divorced.</i>

00:42:01.279 --> 00:42:02.480
<i>Divorced?</i>

00:42:02.945 --> 00:42:07.391
Divorce is
father and mother will have a big fight,

00:42:07.512 --> 00:42:09.584
then the family will be destroyed.

00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:12.566
Vibrating like crazy!

00:42:13.077 --> 00:42:15.407
Want to be alone together and be affectionate?

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.587
Please take a ride on the Ferris wheel!

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.333
<i>Affectionate.</i>

00:42:20.642 --> 00:42:22.120
Father mother!

00:42:23.618 --> 00:42:25.220
Come on up there!

00:42:37.677 --> 00:42:39.327
Next please.

00:42:43.112 --> 00:42:44.217
Aren't you coming up?

00:42:46.786 --> 00:42:48.748
Mom and Dad are just being affectionate.

00:42:48.872 --> 00:42:50.677
Being affectionate...

00:42:51.746 --> 00:42:54.619
Please take care of Anya, okay, Bond!

00:42:56.092 --> 00:42:58.917
Even though he was the one who said he wanted to go up.

00:42:59.475 --> 00:43:00.824
What do you want?

00:43:01.231 --> 00:43:03.819
<i>Is it because I look gloomy?</i>

00:43:04.705 --> 00:43:08.971
<i>It was so bad that Anya was worried too.</i>

00:43:15.517 --> 00:43:17.818
Yor, are you okay?

00:43:18.118 --> 00:43:22.042
Sorry, I was rude earlier.

00:43:22.663 --> 00:43:26.272
It's not that, you've been acting strange since yesterday.

00:43:28.274 --> 00:43:30.325
I saw it by accident.

00:43:30.585 --> 00:43:33.207
When Loid is alone with your lover.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.664
Beloved?

00:43:34.809 --> 00:43:37.407
The woman with the wide-brimmed hat from yesterday.

00:43:43.323 --> 00:43:46.447
You misunderstood, he was just asking for directions.

00:43:46.614 --> 00:43:47.827
Not a lover.

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:53.147
He asked for directions to the art museum,
I don't even know his name.

00:43:53.911 --> 00:43:57.366
So that's how it is.

00:44:07.267 --> 00:44:10.373
I thought we were going to get divorced.

00:44:11.087 --> 00:44:12.257
How could it be.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.697
But I'm really not qualified.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.173
Good as a mother.

00:44:19.494 --> 00:44:21.680
Or as your wife, Loid.

00:44:26.365 --> 00:44:28.420
Didn't we promise, Yor.

00:44:28.918 --> 00:44:30.040
I...

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.499
Whether sick or sad...

00:44:35.118 --> 00:44:37.631
Despite the obstacles
no matter what comes our way...

00:44:38.501 --> 00:44:40.026
We will help each other.

00:44:42.518 --> 00:44:45.982
I will not break that promise.

00:44:46.259 --> 00:44:49.117
Lo-Loid... Ouch...

00:44:49.445 --> 00:44:52.224
Yor, am I still lacking?

00:44:52.338 --> 00:44:55.051
I I...

00:44:56.862 --> 00:44:57.943
Yor...

00:45:08.826 --> 00:45:10.412
Lol!

00:45:16.763 --> 00:45:18.264
<i>Awesome!</i>

00:45:18.764 --> 00:45:21.867
<i>Father, Mother, tremble!</i>

00:45:23.068 --> 00:45:24.547
The Forger family is finished.

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:27.827
It is not like that.
How to explain it, huh...

00:45:27.893 --> 00:45:30.646
Right. We didn't fight.

00:45:30.929 --> 00:45:32.954
Brutal affection?

00:45:33.739 --> 00:45:35.087
- No!
- No, of course not!

00:45:47.859 --> 00:45:50.334
It's already 5 o'clock, right?

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:54.347
Sorry, it must be because I fainted earlier.

00:45:54.584 --> 00:45:56.361
Dad, I'm hungry.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.414
Yor, just go back to the hotel first.

00:46:01.793 --> 00:46:02.681
Huh?

00:46:03.407 --> 00:46:06.233
I will be there
after getting the remaining ingredients.

00:46:06.311 --> 00:46:07.806
Anya is coming too!

00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:09.273
You also go to the hotel.

00:46:10.816 --> 00:46:15.527
<i>McNally's cherry liqueur
very valuable and hard to find.</i>

00:46:16.063 --> 00:46:19.777
<i>Like it or not, we have to use illegal methods.</i>

00:46:20.284 --> 00:46:22.570
<i>It would be difficult if both of them came along.</i>

00:46:24.566 --> 00:46:27.417
Anya, let's just wait at the hotel.

00:46:30.044 --> 00:46:31.224
Okay.

00:46:48.704 --> 00:46:50.427
Colonel Snidel has arrived!

00:46:53.593 --> 00:46:56.454
Route negotiation
with the Republic of Albo finished.

00:46:56.518 --> 00:46:58.269
Type F is finished being customized.

00:46:58.377 --> 00:47:02.552
Norida class fighter aircraft,
Enormity is ready to take off!

00:47:03.478 --> 00:47:06.310
Flight route has been sent
to headquarters.

00:47:06.885 --> 00:47:08.962
Good job, Operations Manager.

00:47:09.346 --> 00:47:12.059
I will give you a long vacation as a reward.

00:47:16.328 --> 00:47:20.236
He leaked our plans to WISE.

00:47:20.832 --> 00:47:23.783
Treason means being punished by death.

00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:27.728
Quick, let's get out of here.
before he was swarmed by flies.

00:47:27.985 --> 00:47:29.236
Oh.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.561
I'm sorry, Colonel.

00:47:31.622 --> 00:47:32.733
Later.

00:47:32.859 --> 00:47:36.322
Actually, how, huh.

00:47:36.598 --> 00:47:39.656
The microfilm has been eaten by someone.

00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:42.783
Huh?!

00:47:43.817 --> 00:47:47.018
Contact with the agent in Phrygis was lost.

00:47:47.558 --> 00:47:50.812
Looks like Snidel
is doing something.

00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:54.058
Has he received the microfilm?

00:47:54.391 --> 00:47:56.093
The possibility is high.

00:47:56.466 --> 00:47:58.779
If that movie
fell into the hands of the Republic of Albo,

00:47:59.516 --> 00:48:02.546
the great war of the East and the West
inevitable.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.352
Luckily, Twilight was in Phrygis.

00:48:07.254 --> 00:48:08.412
Senior there?

00:48:09.326 --> 00:48:13.810
Join Twilight
and seize the microfilm.

00:48:13.939 --> 00:48:15.499
Leave it to me!

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:16.492
Not you.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.112
I guarantee the success of this mission!

00:48:20.692 --> 00:48:22.262
Hey, follow the orders!

00:48:22.263 --> 00:48:25.223
<i>Mission with senior!
Mission with senior!</i>

00:48:25.266 --> 00:48:27.009
Arak! Arak! Arak!

00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:42.436
<i>Nothing!</i>

00:48:50.363 --> 00:48:51.256
<i>Nothing!</i>

00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:19.023
<i>Nothing!</i>

00:49:24.331 --> 00:49:26.333
Hotel!

00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:29.657
TV in the hotel!

00:49:31.831 --> 00:49:33.516
Toilet in the hotel!

00:49:35.685 --> 00:49:37.817
Bed in the hotel!

00:49:41.572 --> 00:49:42.863
Anya too!

00:49:47.721 --> 00:49:50.013
You brought so much.

00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:52.033
What is this flashlight for?

00:49:52.153 --> 00:49:53.784
Play explore!

00:49:54.755 --> 00:49:56.206
What about this one?

00:49:58.291 --> 00:50:02.224
Come out too, you bad guy!
I will not give up the spy secret.

00:50:02.325 --> 00:50:03.325
Bang!

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:09.691
So you're the boss?

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:15.526
That's right, I'm the boss!

00:50:16.195 --> 00:50:20.780
Treasure? Secret?
Please bring all of that back!

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.502
Let's compete, Polite Lady Boss!

00:50:25.688 --> 00:50:27.008
Let's go!

00:50:27.442 --> 00:50:29.595
If that's what you want!

00:50:36.772 --> 00:50:40.115
<i>I've searched all the places I wanted,
but there is none.</i>

00:50:40.742 --> 00:50:42.935
<i>How about this?
You don't have time.</i>

00:50:44.094 --> 00:50:47.268
Franky is really nice.

00:50:47.415 --> 00:50:50.459
Easy to chat with
and fun with you.

00:50:50.513 --> 00:50:53.807
Well, not really...

00:50:55.301 --> 00:50:58.126
Is it okay if I invite a friend later?

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:00.120
There's something I want to talk about.

00:51:00.325 --> 00:51:02.920
Of course!
What do you want to talk about?

00:51:06.278 --> 00:51:08.273
What do you want to talk about?

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.893
The phone.

00:51:10.112 --> 00:51:11.322
Just leave it.

00:51:11.397 --> 00:51:12.397
But...

00:51:13.819 --> 00:51:15.700
I have a bad feeling.

00:51:16.519 --> 00:51:18.180
Yes yes!

00:51:20.068 --> 00:51:21.013
Hello!

00:51:21.073 --> 00:51:21.950
<i>It's me.</i>

00:51:22.127 --> 00:51:23.586
I already guessed.

00:51:24.089 --> 00:51:27.079
Can you find it?
McNally's cherry liqueur?

00:51:27.229 --> 00:51:29.646
<i>Aren't you in Phrygis?</i>

00:51:29.995 --> 00:51:33.321
Yes, it's hard to get it in Frigis.

00:51:33.749 --> 00:51:35.228
- <i>I need it for tomorrow morning.</i>
- Wait...

00:51:36.161 --> 00:51:37.835
It was so sudden.

00:51:37.956 --> 00:51:39.061
<i>Can you find it?</i>

00:51:39.775 --> 00:51:41.361
I will try...

00:51:41.543 --> 00:51:42.428
<i>Please, yes.</i>

00:51:42.544 --> 00:51:44.449
Wait a minute. Hey!

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.047
It takes half a day to get to Frigis, you know!

00:51:49.927 --> 00:51:52.466
<i>I've done everything I can,
the rest...</i>

00:52:06.221 --> 00:52:07.438
I am home.

00:52:08.607 --> 00:52:10.157
WELCOME.

00:52:10.212 --> 00:52:12.795
Sorry, I'll be out again.

00:52:12.872 --> 00:52:14.672
Now?

00:52:14.827 --> 00:52:18.105
In the next town
He said there was a shop that sold alcohol.

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:22.984
It's a bit far indeed,
but the hotel is willing to lend a car.

00:52:23.212 --> 00:52:24.372
Father...

00:52:24.519 --> 00:52:26.438
I woke you up, okay?

00:52:26.818 --> 00:52:28.511
Dad is going again?

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.412
Want to look for more materials.
You just sleep.

00:52:38.667 --> 00:52:39.588
What is it?

00:52:40.953 --> 00:52:43.705
Dad lied.

00:52:44.258 --> 00:52:46.067
He said he would be home soon.

00:52:46.341 --> 00:52:48.993
Ah, I'm sorry.

00:52:49.553 --> 00:52:54.933
<i>Anya must get Stella soon
or Operation Strix will be halted.</i>

00:52:55.329 --> 00:52:58.639
<i>If that happens,
This fake family will be finished.</i>

00:52:58.983 --> 00:53:01.452
<i>His family... is finished?</i>

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:02.799
<i>Why?</i>

00:53:03.019 --> 00:53:04.291
<i>Must get the liquor...</i>

00:53:04.292 --> 00:53:05.292
Father!

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:07.087
Anya is coming too!

00:53:07.806 --> 00:53:12.007
Don't. I'll be home tomorrow morning.
You just go to sleep, okay?

00:53:16.738 --> 00:53:18.667
Anya is just a burden.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.807
Okay.

00:53:35.323 --> 00:53:38.576
Sorry, I'll leave Anya in your care.

00:53:42.243 --> 00:53:43.156
Oh!

00:53:44.799 --> 00:53:46.883
How many people can the loan car fit?

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.529
Fits 5 people.

00:53:49.616 --> 00:53:51.752
How about we go together?

00:53:51.886 --> 00:53:52.963
Yor?

00:53:53.558 --> 00:53:54.916
Because...

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.170
While we are on a family vacation.

00:54:15.159 --> 00:54:18.010
That's what Dad was looking for.

00:54:19.997 --> 00:54:21.756
Have to tell Dad!

00:54:25.834 --> 00:54:28.476
How did you know it was there?

00:54:28.739 --> 00:54:32.083
What?! You can read minds
and Bond can predict the future?!

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:38.135
No, you can't say that.

00:54:45.623 --> 00:54:47.792
When my sister was little.

00:54:49.526 --> 00:54:51.072
Older brother!

00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:58.453
<i>On special days like birthdays
or take a walk.</i>

00:54:58.542 --> 00:55:01.585
He will always be a big deal.

00:55:01.955 --> 00:55:03.987
Brother, look!

00:55:04.324 --> 00:55:08.077
<i>It seems like he's happy to be out all day
play with me.</i>

00:55:11.945 --> 00:55:13.237
Anya is the same.

00:55:14.474 --> 00:55:17.777
Throughout the journey he was always cheerful.

00:55:27.262 --> 00:55:30.340
Anya has been so much fun since she left the orphanage!

00:55:30.526 --> 00:55:31.700
Thanks to Dad!

00:55:33.214 --> 00:55:36.263
He was really looking forward to this trip.

00:55:36.924 --> 00:55:41.679
Her bag is full of snacks
and toys for all of us.

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:46.623
Because it often makes Yuri lonely,

00:55:46.772 --> 00:55:48.065
So I understand Anya's feelings.

00:55:49.258 --> 00:55:52.198
Surely Anya wants to have fun
with Loid.

00:55:52.702 --> 00:55:56.585
Alone separated from family
it feels so lonely.

00:56:00.624 --> 00:56:01.875
Loid.

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:05.617
If you want to go to the next city,
how about just being together?

00:56:06.046 --> 00:56:10.491
For today only,
let's let Anya stay up late.

00:56:16.672 --> 00:56:17.779
That is true.

00:56:19.355 --> 00:56:20.759
<i>Room service.</i>

00:56:21.256 --> 00:56:22.766
I shouldn't have ordered.

00:56:29.725 --> 00:56:30.746
<i>Nightfall?!</i>

00:56:32.932 --> 00:56:36.225
I forgot I ordered
plus size bathrobe.

00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:41.545
Why are you here?

00:56:41.591 --> 00:56:43.138
THERE IS A MISSION.
For room service.

00:56:47.007 --> 00:56:49.842
He speaks normally.
It's just the two of us here.

00:56:49.867 --> 00:56:50.856
<i>Just the two of us?</i>

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.267
I'm also on a mission...

00:56:52.334 --> 00:56:55.220
<i>Can be alone with seniors
in a place like this.</i>

00:57:00.413 --> 00:57:02.204
Love!

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.732
Anya?

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.924
And the microfilm is in hot pursuit.

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:22.227
If it falls into the hands of the Albo Republic,
will be the trigger for war.

00:57:23.526 --> 00:57:27.573
The one who is carrying out the action is the Commando
Military Intelligence Agency Special Reconnaissance.

00:57:28.059 --> 00:57:30.643
Possibly commanded
by Colonel Snidel.

00:57:30.766 --> 00:57:32.307
It was the man apparently.

00:57:32.498 --> 00:57:34.565
Loid! Anya is missing!

00:57:34.936 --> 00:57:36.767
It looks like he got out through the window.

00:57:36.818 --> 00:57:38.325
What did you say?!

00:57:40.342 --> 00:57:42.024
He left this.

00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:46.993
Can't read.

00:57:59.814 --> 00:58:01.315
Meet!

00:58:02.541 --> 00:58:03.622
Anya!

00:58:03.865 --> 00:58:05.679
- Anya!
- Anya!

00:58:05.913 --> 00:58:06.913
Reply me!

00:58:07.261 --> 00:58:09.764
The girl he was looking for hasn't been found yet.

00:58:11.557 --> 00:58:12.892
Correct.

00:58:13.124 --> 00:58:15.500
Squads 7 and 8 are combing the highway.

00:58:15.957 --> 00:58:17.904
We will continue the search.

00:58:18.617 --> 00:58:19.618
Have found?

00:58:19.774 --> 00:58:21.930
Not yet, it just feels...

00:58:24.135 --> 00:58:26.490
Is this believable?

00:58:26.778 --> 00:58:28.329
Thank You.

00:58:34.719 --> 00:58:38.398
With this you will get Stella
and the Forger family will be safe.

00:58:43.685 --> 00:58:45.340
It's not him, right?

00:58:45.624 --> 00:58:47.005
It seems like?

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.400
Chocolate thief on the train!

00:59:12.433 --> 00:59:15.136
Ouch! Let go of me, you bastard!

00:59:17.585 --> 00:59:18.615
Fast!

00:59:18.662 --> 00:59:21.110
Just take the east road number 2, okay?

00:59:21.199 --> 00:59:22.926
According to the prophecy, the west road...

00:59:22.971 --> 00:59:24.973
Whatever, the important thing is hurry up!

00:59:40.952 --> 00:59:44.044
We are leaving
after the microfilm was returned.

00:59:44.358 --> 00:59:46.020
What about Type F?

00:59:46.544 --> 00:59:47.657
Carry him.

00:59:50.537 --> 00:59:53.004
After all, there will be war soon.

00:59:53.637 --> 00:59:56.814
Anya! Please answer!

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.638
Anya!

00:59:58.703 --> 01:00:01.167
Damn, where did he go?

01:00:03.263 --> 01:00:05.240
Hey, are you okay, Bond?

01:00:07.902 --> 01:00:10.742
Where's Anya? She's separated from you, huh?

01:00:16.426 --> 01:00:18.442
What do you think it means?

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.441
Hold on a minute, Bond.

01:00:25.973 --> 01:00:27.107
What's that?

01:00:28.299 --> 01:00:30.041
<i>Special Reconnaissance Command?</i>

01:00:30.604 --> 01:00:32.187
<i>Don't tell Anya...</i>

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:35.221
<i>...involved in military matters.</i>

01:00:36.573 --> 01:00:39.776
Sir, you dropped something.

01:00:40.323 --> 01:00:42.693
Our priority now is microfilm.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.026
Please postpone Operation Strix.

01:00:48.238 --> 01:00:49.740
Miss Waitress.

01:00:50.837 --> 01:00:53.039
Can I ask you for help?

01:00:57.091 --> 01:00:59.266
The person who snatched Anya's snack!

01:00:59.433 --> 01:01:03.437
Who would have thought you ate that chocolate?
before we met.

01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:06.249
You're the boss of thieves, apparently!

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.482
Hush, don't you dare mess with the Colonel!

01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:10.360
Speak politely!

01:01:12.519 --> 01:01:14.886
Did you go to the toilet after that?

01:01:15.892 --> 01:01:17.906
Have you pooped yet?

01:01:18.098 --> 01:01:19.093
Shit?

01:01:20.953 --> 01:01:25.710
<i>Tch, who would have thought microfilm?
Inside the chocolate he can eat.</i>

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:29.753
<i>Damn, I have to wait for him to poop first.
I just killed him.</i>

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.814
<i>There's treasure in the chocolate?!</i>

01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:40.554
<i>Anya will be killed if she defecates!</i>

01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:48.621
<i>Anya is so cute,
so I've never had a bowel movement.</i>

01:01:50.836 --> 01:01:52.748
That's a lie, I'm sorry.

01:01:53.122 --> 01:01:56.826
Take him, report immediately
if the stool comes out.

01:01:57.196 --> 01:01:58.788
Ready to execute!

01:01:59.606 --> 01:02:01.209
Oh, you need to poop, huh?

01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:04.510
N-No, just cold!

01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:21.590
If this is a military aviation radio
still on.

01:02:21.736 --> 01:02:25.227
<i>Enormity at the base.
As per operational orders...</i>

01:02:25.279 --> 01:02:27.666
I guessed the channel hadn't been changed.

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.853
<i>...starting a secret flight
towards the Republic of Albo.</i>

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:36.786
<i>The next connection will use the GC channel.
Aviation code 0714.</i>

01:02:38.497 --> 01:02:39.448
What's this...

01:02:39.538 --> 01:02:41.690
GC, 0714...

01:02:41.912 --> 01:02:43.866
<i>It's cold...</i>

01:02:43.912 --> 01:02:45.838
This? Anya's voice?!

01:02:45.885 --> 01:02:48.632
Will freeze to death.

01:02:48.738 --> 01:02:50.860
Yes, yes, come here!

01:02:50.938 --> 01:02:54.733
It's your fault for eating the microfilm.

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.879
<i>The microfilm was eaten?</i>

01:02:56.987 --> 01:02:59.171
<i>How could that be?</i>

01:03:03.425 --> 01:03:05.774
Anya seems to be being cared for by the soldiers.

01:03:06.621 --> 01:03:11.506
I just heard it on the radio.
They said they were looking after a 5 year old girl.

01:03:11.651 --> 01:03:13.880
The soldiers? How is that possible?

01:03:14.203 --> 01:03:17.326
Please step back, I'll be right back.

01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:28.369
<i>If I am not mistaken
two people who attacked Anya.</i>

01:03:28.462 --> 01:03:30.873
<i>Could it be that they are soldiers?</i>

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.124
<i>But if I tell Loid.</i>

01:03:33.224 --> 01:03:37.440
<i>Will be found out
if I ever beat them.</i>

01:03:39.955 --> 01:03:42.457
How about we go together?

01:03:43.106 --> 01:03:44.507
While on family vacation.

01:03:46.652 --> 01:03:48.454
The family must be together.

01:04:15.106 --> 01:04:17.148
<i>Please, Twilight.</i>

01:04:20.178 --> 01:04:24.973
The fate of the world depends
on the fate of the microfilm.

01:04:40.395 --> 01:04:41.516
Want to defecate?

01:04:41.576 --> 01:04:43.825
No! This is...

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:46.209
Dances taught at school.

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.749
<i>If it stops moving...</i>

01:04:48.824 --> 01:04:50.235
<i>...will leak!</i>

01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:54.929
You're late.

01:04:55.043 --> 01:04:57.830
It was long past time for his turn to change.

01:04:58.167 --> 01:05:01.829
Sorry. Let me continue by myself.

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:05.596
Who are you?

01:05:18.024 --> 01:05:20.031
<i>Senior, can you hear me?</i>

01:05:20.444 --> 01:05:22.048
According to the information here.

01:05:22.193 --> 01:05:26.065
The fighter plane that Colonel Snidel was riding in
fly in a north-northeast direction.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.062
<i>The distance is about 3 km.</i>

01:05:28.164 --> 01:05:30.658
You're amazing to know that far,
in a short time.

01:05:31.038 --> 01:05:33.250
You are indeed reliable.

01:05:33.568 --> 01:05:36.911
<i>Reliable... Reliable...</i>

01:05:42.265 --> 01:05:45.290
<i>Senior, if you want,
whenever I'm ready.</i>

01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:48.059
<i>I am ready to be your life partner.</i>

01:05:49.203 --> 01:05:50.552
Twilight Seniors.

01:05:50.925 --> 01:05:54.054
In my opinion, the wife's role should be
for Operation Strix...

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:56.611
...handed over to me right now.

01:05:57.591 --> 01:05:58.458
Senior?

01:06:00.467 --> 01:06:02.765
The connection was disconnected.

01:06:04.871 --> 01:06:09.385
Yei, yei, yei! Dance from school!

01:06:09.436 --> 01:06:11.259
Yeah, yeah..

01:06:13.915 --> 01:06:16.339
Dances taught at school...

01:06:16.377 --> 01:06:17.659
Oh gosh, I want to go out...

01:06:21.212 --> 01:06:23.486
I can't take it anymore...

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:46.742
I am the God of Poop.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:48.734
God of Poop?

01:06:49.345 --> 01:06:51.217
Oh Anya the Hero.

01:06:52.637 --> 01:06:55.133
You've fought.

01:06:55.391 --> 01:07:00.086
You have fought hard to overcome obstacles
to protect world peace.

01:07:00.409 --> 01:07:03.331
It's enough.
You don't have to fight anymore.

01:07:03.438 --> 01:07:07.677
Loosen up your butt and take a break,
oh Anya the Hero.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.331
God of Poop...

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:12.058
Defecate...

01:07:12.822 --> 01:07:17.246
Let's Go to Toilet Heaven
which is full of peace.

01:07:55.932 --> 01:07:57.934
Toilet Heaven!

01:08:08.622 --> 01:08:11.254
Shit!

01:08:33.566 --> 01:08:35.352
What is the God of Defecation?

01:08:35.525 --> 01:08:37.860
Need to poop, huh? Finally!

01:08:38.236 --> 01:08:39.818
Never mind!

01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:42.320
Still haven't you said anything?

01:08:42.615 --> 01:08:43.854
Forgive us.

01:08:44.009 --> 01:08:46.208
Then cut open his stomach.

01:08:46.883 --> 01:08:48.248
You can, right?

01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:50.235
But isn't that...

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:52.331
See, you can do it?

01:08:54.239 --> 01:08:55.136
Good!

01:08:55.404 --> 01:08:59.143
Three yellow! Three yellow!

01:08:59.579 --> 01:09:04.293
Three yellow! Three yellow!

01:09:05.257 --> 01:09:06.599
What are you doing?

01:09:06.861 --> 01:09:11.195
According to my coffee forecast,
yellow color and lucky number 3.

01:09:11.803 --> 01:09:14.002
That's no longer a prophecy.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.662
What did the colonel say?

01:09:23.438 --> 01:09:24.655
Seriously?!

01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:25.644
Please, yes.

01:09:25.696 --> 01:09:29.478
No, you're the one being ordered around.
You go there.

01:09:29.552 --> 01:09:31.229
How could I do something that scary?

01:09:31.663 --> 01:09:34.826
How could I cut open a small child's stomach?

01:09:36.024 --> 01:09:37.986
Rock, scissors, paper.

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:41.604
Yes!

01:09:41.629 --> 01:09:42.676
I lose!

01:09:42.708 --> 01:09:44.369
<i>I'm going to be killed!</i>

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.542
<i>I'm the one who can stand it.</i>

01:09:47.212 --> 01:09:48.809
<i>Then I split it.</i>

01:09:49.695 --> 01:09:52.658
Father mother...

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.111
There he is.

01:10:00.733 --> 01:10:02.854
Here is Frigid 0988.

01:10:03.012 --> 01:10:06.434
In case of emergency
due to fuel system failure.

01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:10.665
If left alone, we will fall.
Please allow permission for an emergency landing.

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:15.150
Colonel, unknown aircraft
request permission to land.

01:10:15.451 --> 01:10:16.790
Shoot.

01:10:16.902 --> 01:10:17.762
But...

01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:20.849
Shoot.

01:10:21.069 --> 01:10:23.612
<i>Does it sound right?
Please allow me to land.</i>

01:10:34.843 --> 01:10:35.816
Seriously.

01:10:48.325 --> 01:10:50.828
Even shooting a fly is not good enough!

01:10:52.425 --> 01:10:56.589
Stop the warning shots.
Launch anti-aircraft guided missiles.

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:58.293
But...

01:10:58.325 --> 01:11:02.253
It's a secret weapon, not allowed
used during peacetime.

01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:05.332
There will be war soon.
Launch.

01:11:18.944 --> 01:11:20.220
Guided missiles?!

01:11:43.544 --> 01:11:44.954
Loid.

01:11:45.077 --> 01:11:47.591
Your driving is so rough.

01:11:47.662 --> 01:11:49.415
- You got caught too.
- Let go...

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.598
Ahhh... Let go!

01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:53.934
Father mother!

01:11:54.385 --> 01:11:56.187
Don't take it to heart, okay?

01:11:57.797 --> 01:12:01.300
Don't!

01:12:09.517 --> 01:12:10.678
If this is how it will be...

01:12:14.569 --> 01:12:15.644
He's coming!

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:16.856
Take him down!

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.521
What is this?!

01:12:35.245 --> 01:12:36.310
He ran away!

01:12:37.794 --> 01:12:39.567
Hey, stop!

01:12:39.663 --> 01:12:41.207
<i>Leaked!</i>

01:12:46.316 --> 01:12:48.899
<i>I have to find Anya first.</i>

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:59.977
Hey, what happened? Loid?

01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:04.331
Loid?

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:06.776
I have to catch up with Loid immediately.

01:13:07.207 --> 01:13:09.670
But from here you can't go down.

01:13:11.765 --> 01:13:13.240
In that case...

01:13:21.615 --> 01:13:24.080
I have to break through from above.

01:13:27.715 --> 01:13:30.387
Check if anyone survived.

01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.226
Colonel, there's a woman running.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:34.607
Woman?

01:13:34.891 --> 01:13:37.997
There is a woman running
on the outer body of the aircraft.

01:13:38.158 --> 01:13:40.258
This is not the time for jokes.

01:13:40.767 --> 01:13:44.112
We are trying
disrupting the balance of East and West...

01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:56.623
Kill him.

01:13:57.354 --> 01:14:00.311
It's clear that he
from the fighter plane earlier.

01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:01.713
That means he's the enemy.

01:14:22.108 --> 01:14:25.243
Tch, how about this?

01:14:33.713 --> 01:14:35.084
Wow.

01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:38.772
There was an explosion in Deck block 3A.
Allegedly caused by a grenade.

01:14:39.121 --> 01:14:40.332
The woman...

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:54.288
Sorry, I came to pick you up
my husband and daughter.

01:14:55.003 --> 01:14:57.274
Oh my, I fainted.

01:14:59.311 --> 01:15:01.801
The woman had infiltrated the ship.

01:15:02.045 --> 01:15:03.255
Get rid of him.

01:15:03.328 --> 01:15:06.682
The explosion that just happened made
the fuel line around it is burning.

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:08.564
The fire is getting wider.

01:15:08.617 --> 01:15:09.950
Turn it off immediately.

01:15:11.076 --> 01:15:12.567
What is it this time?!

01:15:12.635 --> 01:15:14.956
The fire had reached the engine room.

01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:19.408
There are only a few people here,
you guys go put out the fire!

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:20.973
How about the woman?

01:15:22.741 --> 01:15:24.841
Deploy Type F.

01:15:26.465 --> 01:15:28.118
But, isn't that...

01:15:28.664 --> 01:15:30.198
I told you.

01:15:31.105 --> 01:15:33.130
Now is war.

01:15:39.958 --> 01:15:41.750
Stop!

01:15:43.084 --> 01:15:44.756
I said stop!

01:15:44.781 --> 01:15:45.913
Got you! Uwah...!

01:15:46.155 --> 01:15:47.155
Me.. Ahhh...!

01:15:47.914 --> 01:15:49.063
Where is he?!

01:15:49.064 --> 01:15:50.526
He's here!

01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:55.860
<i>There, let's look there!</i>

01:15:55.907 --> 01:15:57.829
<i>Damn, where did he go?</i>

01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:18.702
Toilet!

01:16:19.061 --> 01:16:21.202
- Why did it happen?
- Is it true that he is alone?

01:16:21.227 --> 01:16:21.916
No.

01:16:22.017 --> 01:16:23.267
He said he was a long-haired man.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.615
<i>What was that explosion just now?</i>

01:16:26.035 --> 01:16:28.402
<i>What was the impact of the collision?</i>

01:16:28.843 --> 01:16:32.222
<i>I might as well take advantage of this chaos.</i>

01:16:33.018 --> 01:16:35.282
Direct the remaining personnel
to the engine room.

01:16:35.307 --> 01:16:35.909
Good.

01:16:48.843 --> 01:16:51.766
<i>I'll borrow your form for a moment.</i>

01:16:55.599 --> 01:16:56.272
Fast!

01:16:56.297 --> 01:16:58.612
It's over if the fire goes out
up to the ammunition room.

01:17:00.755 --> 01:17:04.468
Excuse me, I want to pick you up.
my husband and daughter.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.020
- Has anyone seen them?
- That's the woman in question!

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:28.558
Just start shooting.

01:17:29.581 --> 01:17:35.129
So they really are bad people
who attacked Anya on the train?

01:17:36.046 --> 01:17:37.196
If it's true...

01:17:42.656 --> 01:17:44.530
Almost.

01:17:48.802 --> 01:17:52.976
My toilet paper predictions are great, aren't they?

01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:55.583
Oh no...

01:17:58.185 --> 01:17:59.563
His son was successfully arrested.

01:17:59.873 --> 01:18:02.463
Bring him here immediately.

01:18:57.778 --> 01:18:59.239
Who are you?

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:16.287
Please stop attacking.

01:19:37.671 --> 01:19:39.122
That's all it seems...

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:42.876
...Miss Intruder.

01:19:45.819 --> 01:19:48.111
It seems I have no other choice.

01:20:01.036 --> 01:20:03.709
The ammunition room cooling engine is dead!

01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:05.548
Where are the hostages?

01:20:05.644 --> 01:20:06.554
Hostage?

01:20:06.722 --> 01:20:08.596
A small child, who is 5 years old.

01:20:08.814 --> 01:20:13.370
Just now, NCO Domitri
take him to the bridge.

01:20:14.861 --> 01:20:16.070
<i>The platform?</i>

01:20:17.834 --> 01:20:19.335
Have you said anything?

01:20:19.498 --> 01:20:24.343
At least he used the ship's toilet,
should be in the holding tank.

01:20:25.051 --> 01:20:28.554
There is still a possibility
left on his body.

01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:31.473
Put him in the room downstairs.

01:20:32.484 --> 01:20:35.883
After this commotion was over,
I will be the one to split him.

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:38.423
The Colonel himself?

01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:41.623
Coincidentally, I wanted to eat kebab.

01:20:42.488 --> 01:20:45.556
So I just bought a big knife.

01:20:49.241 --> 01:20:51.152
Hurry up and go there you guys!

01:20:51.194 --> 01:20:51.904
Good!

01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:54.049
But... where to?

01:20:54.366 --> 01:20:56.571
Immediately enter the holding tank...

01:20:56.844 --> 01:20:59.807
...and look for the microfilm
in that sea of shit!

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.393
If not...

01:21:01.743 --> 01:21:05.266
I will also chop you up like kebabs.

01:21:05.376 --> 01:21:07.355
Ready to execute!

01:21:09.954 --> 01:21:12.997
Damn, what bad luck.

01:21:13.234 --> 01:21:16.421
It's because of a greedy kid that he's so unlucky.

01:21:16.698 --> 01:21:20.862
My arm still hurts
because of being bitten by a stupid dog.

01:21:41.359 --> 01:21:42.861
Excuse me.

01:21:47.776 --> 01:21:51.404
<i>There isn't any.
This should be the only platform.</i>

01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:52.885
What is it?

01:21:53.381 --> 01:21:56.323
I came to report
extinguishing process on Colonel.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.296
Later.
I am busy.

01:22:04.105 --> 01:22:07.398
<i>Anya should have been brought here.
But where is he?</i>

01:22:07.926 --> 01:22:10.366
<i>Dad is coming!</i>

01:22:16.288 --> 01:22:18.691
I told you later.

01:22:18.865 --> 01:22:19.931
Go, hurry.

01:22:20.153 --> 01:22:22.353
<i>If I stop, I will be suspicious.</i>

01:22:23.418 --> 01:22:24.393
<i>How about this?</i>

01:22:25.233 --> 01:22:28.146
<i>Dad, Anya is here!</i>

01:22:45.522 --> 01:22:46.582
<i>Father...</i>

01:22:47.715 --> 01:22:49.060
<i>...already realized!</i>

01:23:00.638 --> 01:23:01.806
Excuse me.

01:23:12.068 --> 01:23:13.605
Wait, Captain.

01:23:14.839 --> 01:23:18.114
Since when did you smell?
so like a city person?

01:23:26.747 --> 01:23:29.141
Tourists at the Restaurant
Rubble and Bonds apparently!

01:23:29.817 --> 01:23:32.950
Damn, it was just a little bit more.

01:23:33.428 --> 01:23:35.824
Don't underestimate a gourmet's sense of smell.

01:23:35.901 --> 01:23:39.363
Guard the exit!
Don't let him escape!

01:23:43.581 --> 01:23:46.500
He himself.
Surround and finish him off!

01:24:42.646 --> 01:24:43.666
<i>This...</i>

01:24:51.296 --> 01:24:55.272
This won't hurt me.

01:24:56.535 --> 01:24:58.008
How about this?

01:25:12.509 --> 01:25:14.921
That's great, but...

01:25:19.209 --> 01:25:22.091
A newly developed poison gas grenade.

01:25:22.239 --> 01:25:23.779
I'll try it here.

01:25:24.997 --> 01:25:26.499
<i>Poison gas?!</i>

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.625
<i>Dad is in danger!</i>

01:25:45.591 --> 01:25:49.543
<i>It's Anya's turn to save Dad!</i>

01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:54.091
Instead of meremere,

01:25:54.871 --> 01:25:57.117
eat this!

01:26:02.075 --> 01:26:02.984
<i>Gas?!</i>

01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:09.052
<i>Father!</i>

01:26:25.945 --> 01:26:27.777
What happened?!

01:26:43.211 --> 01:26:46.139
Why are you silent?
Shoot this impostor!

01:26:46.171 --> 01:26:49.193
I'm the real one, shoot him quickly!

01:26:49.455 --> 01:26:51.246
You bastard!

01:26:53.723 --> 01:26:55.881
<i>You're the only one with a sharp nose.</i>

01:26:56.184 --> 01:26:59.177
<i>That means there's just another scam left.</i>

01:26:59.384 --> 01:27:00.827
<i>What a cunning person.</i>

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:04.935
<i>I will skin it and make it
your fried pork skin!</i>

01:27:12.294 --> 01:27:14.627
<i>Want to skin me, huh?</i>

01:27:19.908 --> 01:27:21.855
Don't think my skin is that thin...

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.570
...until you can skin it easily!

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:37.476
Which one is that?

01:27:37.549 --> 01:27:39.300
What is the original?

01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:45.685
You think I will lose
with a cheater?

01:27:45.888 --> 01:27:48.769
S-sorry, sir!

01:27:48.818 --> 01:27:52.331
We must head to the Albo Republic immediately.

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.198
Abandon ship.

01:27:55.166 --> 01:27:56.164
Abandon ship?

01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:57.982
Abandon this ship?

01:27:58.235 --> 01:28:00.931
Soldiers must obey the orders of their superiors.

01:28:01.719 --> 01:28:03.590
This ship has reached its limit.

01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:07.599
We leave the ship
and continue operations from land.

01:28:08.231 --> 01:28:10.078
All personnel, abandon ship.

01:28:10.792 --> 01:28:12.479
What about the Colonel?

01:28:12.818 --> 01:28:14.152
Hurry up and go!

01:28:14.292 --> 01:28:15.352
Execute!

01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:18.890
<i>All personnel abandon ship!
Fast!</i>

01:28:19.684 --> 01:28:20.797
Excuse me!

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:39.310
It's useless waiting for my bullets to run out.

01:28:42.903 --> 01:28:44.222
<i>The bullet...</i>

01:28:44.702 --> 01:28:46.077
<i>...is in the body.</i>

01:29:00.528 --> 01:29:02.501
This is the final warning.

01:29:02.857 --> 01:29:05.319
Please get out of there.

01:29:06.064 --> 01:29:07.486
I...

01:29:08.481 --> 01:29:11.899
...just want to pick up
my husband and daughter.

01:29:12.043 --> 01:29:13.112
Don't joke.

01:29:13.241 --> 01:29:17.800
You guys rot here
shared future of East and West.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.712
Oh, I see.

01:30:12.045 --> 01:30:13.156
It's useless.

01:30:14.568 --> 01:30:16.415
The knife won't be able to...

01:30:20.974 --> 01:30:22.363
Lipstick?

01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:32.176
Half of the lipstick...

01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:34.676
...it is said to be made of oil.

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.294
Father!

01:31:10.544 --> 01:31:11.509
Anya!

01:31:12.993 --> 01:31:16.536
Father!

01:31:19.316 --> 01:31:20.781
Are you okay, Anya?

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:32.125
Cherry wine?

01:31:32.565 --> 01:31:33.811
How do you...

01:31:33.927 --> 01:31:36.359
The ingredient Dad's been looking for!

01:31:36.899 --> 01:31:40.392
That's why you ran away from the hotel?

01:31:56.975 --> 01:31:58.520
Anyway, we have to run away.

01:32:12.781 --> 01:32:14.122
- Yor?!
- Mom!

01:32:14.423 --> 01:32:16.668
Loid! Anya!

01:32:17.076 --> 01:32:19.262
Mom!

01:32:20.178 --> 01:32:22.591
Are you two hurt?

01:32:23.026 --> 01:32:25.678
Yor yourself, how come you're here?

01:32:25.711 --> 01:32:26.404
What?

01:32:26.638 --> 01:32:30.986
That... I didn't mean to.
jump into Loid's plane.

01:32:31.194 --> 01:32:32.531
Accidentally jump?

01:32:32.759 --> 01:32:34.319
Because that's why...

01:32:34.509 --> 01:32:38.103
Didn't we promise?
to hang out together?

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.072
Therefore...

01:32:41.133 --> 01:32:43.099
But why did it come to this...

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.325
By the way,

01:32:46.453 --> 01:32:50.537
what are the people here
are they really soldiers?

01:32:50.842 --> 01:32:53.095
How, yeah...

01:32:53.187 --> 01:32:55.349
Th-They stole the chocolate!

01:32:56.518 --> 01:33:01.222
Anya was chased by accident
eat their precious chocolate on the train!

01:33:02.484 --> 01:33:03.623
<i>So that's the reason.</i>

01:33:03.973 --> 01:33:08.050
<i>It turns out they were hiding
microfilm in chocolate.</i>

01:33:08.873 --> 01:33:10.606
I-I've heard!

01:33:11.046 --> 01:33:12.206
Chocolate Snatchers Gang.

01:33:12.533 --> 01:33:18.060
In cold areas, it often occurs
stealing chocolate to warm the body.

01:33:18.423 --> 01:33:21.160
Who would have thought they too
stealing a military ship.

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:25.954
It turns out that there are many bad people in this world.

01:33:26.594 --> 01:33:30.081
You said it was unintentional
eat the chocolate?

01:33:30.401 --> 01:33:32.137
What are you doing?!

01:33:32.711 --> 01:33:35.043
<i>Luckily, he was still safe.</i>

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.831
That's right, Anya.

01:33:37.054 --> 01:33:40.058
Don't take it carelessly
other people's stuff.

01:33:43.477 --> 01:33:45.629
Forgive me.

01:33:57.228 --> 01:34:00.601
Come on, get down from here,
This ship is about to crash.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:02.118
Father mother!

01:34:07.885 --> 01:34:10.078
If it's like this, it will fall in that city.

01:34:10.425 --> 01:34:11.365
Father...

01:34:11.459 --> 01:34:15.794
I'll run away later.
I'll crash this ship outside the city.

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.051
Can you drive it?

01:34:20.105 --> 01:34:23.604
When I was in school, I did it once.
during part-time work.

01:34:28.753 --> 01:34:30.651
Loid is great.

01:34:31.535 --> 01:34:32.871
Uh, what is that?

01:34:32.896 --> 01:34:34.449
Coming over here?

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.795
Why, does it feel like it's burning?

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.231
What is that?

01:34:45.571 --> 01:34:49.485
<i>Damn, the propulsion system
and the elevator is dead.</i>

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:52.470
Father, fight!

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:56.230
Stay cool.
The rudder fins are still functional.

01:35:31.208 --> 01:35:33.220
Let me help you.

01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.082
Anya too!

01:36:34.799 --> 01:36:36.379
Senior.

01:37:46.764 --> 01:37:49.743
What a splash!

01:37:53.793 --> 01:37:54.938
Isn't that...

01:37:57.313 --> 01:37:59.018
<i>Microfilm?!</i>

01:37:59.515 --> 01:38:01.791
<i>It's stuck in his teeth, apparently?</i>

01:38:02.352 --> 01:38:04.506
What's that?

01:38:09.853 --> 01:38:11.668
Our return ticket.

01:38:19.441 --> 01:38:22.893
<i>Military fighter plane crash
at lake Phrygis last night...</i>

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.847
<i>...due to an accident
during flight training...</i>

01:38:25.904 --> 01:38:30.833
Frigid. My sister said she was on holiday there,
is he okay?

01:38:31.019 --> 01:38:33.480
Yuri, please document this too.

01:38:34.829 --> 01:38:38.569
Why should we help
solve their problems?

01:38:38.776 --> 01:38:42.294
Don't be like that, if there is an accident
due to the negligence of the army,

01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:44.175
the people will panic.

01:38:47.563 --> 01:38:50.916
<i>WISE is suspected of interfering in this case.</i>

01:38:51.002 --> 01:38:52.849
<i>But there is no information left.</i>

01:38:53.163 --> 01:38:55.069
<i>Who can do this kind of thing.</i>

01:38:55.533 --> 01:38:58.769
Could it be that this is his doing again?
Twilight!

01:39:05.087 --> 01:39:06.901
Good job, Twilight.

01:39:07.248 --> 01:39:09.976
State Security Agency
help put out the fire...

01:39:10.001 --> 01:39:13.428
...but it seems your tracks
there is nothing left.

01:39:13.642 --> 01:39:14.441
Correct.

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:19.903
The Forger family just enjoys
just a family vacation.

01:39:25.685 --> 01:39:28.703
Speaking of Operation Strix...

01:39:28.810 --> 01:39:31.197
I have news about that too.

01:39:31.763 --> 01:39:36.522
Operation Strix is back
handed over to you.

01:39:36.769 --> 01:39:38.910
Eh? Then what about Depple?

01:39:40.913 --> 01:39:44.336
Someone leaked it
if he is cheating.

01:39:44.799 --> 01:39:47.761
Then he was dumped by his father-in-law
who is a politician...

01:39:47.786 --> 01:39:50.659
...and the problem of withdrawing his mission
so it's not clear.

01:39:50.973 --> 01:39:53.975
It was a bad moment for him.

01:39:54.092 --> 01:39:56.281
Instead, he acted so stupidly.

01:40:17.210 --> 01:40:19.492
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:21.114
How is your patient?

01:40:21.337 --> 01:40:22.987
There were no serious injuries.

01:40:23.459 --> 01:40:26.552
I thought something was wrong
until I got a sudden call.

01:40:26.897 --> 01:40:29.269
In that case, thank God.

01:40:29.326 --> 01:40:31.238
Father!

01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:33.745
There are no fish!

01:40:33.772 --> 01:40:35.633
It's called a fountain.

01:40:35.787 --> 01:40:36.722
Mom!

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.927
Yes?

01:40:55.135 --> 01:40:59.961
<i>Even though Operation Strix was resumed,
I can't be careless.</i>

01:41:00.247 --> 01:41:02.734
<i>This time must focus
to get Stella.</i>

01:41:04.328 --> 01:41:07.160
<i>The Forger Family isn't over yet!</i>

01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:09.447
Let us go home.

01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:13.093
We will practice making meremere
for cooking class tomorrow.

01:41:13.668 --> 01:41:16.448
Practice, practice!
Duh, duh!

01:41:19.944 --> 01:41:20.985
Mom!

01:41:22.216 --> 01:41:23.774
Dad, hold my hand.

01:41:31.401 --> 01:41:33.387
Anya wants to make a delicious snack!

01:41:33.561 --> 01:41:35.088
I will help too.

01:41:35.644 --> 01:41:37.341
Yor you better not...

01:41:37.435 --> 01:41:39.541
Anya can make it herself.

01:41:39.931 --> 01:41:43.354
Oh, yeah. This is Anya's cooking class.

01:41:43.921 --> 01:41:47.294
Anya will fight!
Definitely get first place!

01:41:51.465 --> 01:41:53.013
The preparation was perfect.

01:41:53.246 --> 01:41:56.454
I will make an orange layer cake.

01:41:56.549 --> 01:41:58.947
Have been practicing with my family's pastry chef.

01:41:59.362 --> 01:42:01.282
What does Anya want to do?

01:42:02.157 --> 01:42:03.316
Remember.

01:42:03.714 --> 01:42:05.236
Remember?

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:08.289
A very old snack.

01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:14.961
If it turns out well, hopefully there will be a second son
also want to try it.

01:42:16.855 --> 01:42:19.212
<i>Plan B, the friends with benefits plan.</i>

01:42:19.288 --> 01:42:21.347
Anya, isn't that...

01:42:21.734 --> 01:42:26.286
W-Why do I have to eat?
what snacks do you make?

01:42:26.879 --> 01:42:27.939
You country bumpkin!

01:42:29.258 --> 01:42:31.290
Do you really not want to?

01:42:35.237 --> 01:42:36.392
Stupid, stupid!

01:42:36.479 --> 01:42:39.705
Who wants to eat your cooking!
Makes you vomit! You idiot!

01:42:39.746 --> 01:42:40.871
Stupid!

01:42:41.203 --> 01:42:42.777
He is so evil.

01:42:42.966 --> 01:42:45.431
<i>The friends with benefits plan failed miserably.</i>

01:42:50.416 --> 01:42:52.273
Anya is back.

01:42:56.005 --> 01:42:57.646
<i>It seems to have failed.</i>

01:42:58.150 --> 01:43:00.766
Anya, how was the cooking class?

01:43:03.446 --> 01:43:04.626
Completely destroyed.

01:43:05.353 --> 01:43:09.259
The school kitchen is damaged,
cooking class postponed.

01:43:09.706 --> 01:43:13.393
Due to schedule changes, the jury will
replaced by the vice principal.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.053
If not the principal,
they are useless.

01:43:17.199 --> 01:43:18.505
Deputy head...

01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:22.051
If I'm not mistaken, I've read it before
in the school newspaper...

01:43:22.139 --> 01:43:24.407
...he likes berry pudding
from the south.

01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:27.767
Want to go there?

01:43:27.917 --> 01:43:29.128
Come on!

01:43:29.352 --> 01:43:30.604
Want to!

01:43:35.045 --> 01:43:36.669
The southern area is here.

01:43:37.025 --> 01:43:39.697
It was warm, so we packed little.

01:43:39.868 --> 01:43:41.450
Close to the sea.

01:43:41.523 --> 01:43:45.066
The sea!
Byur! Byar, byur!

01:43:45.429 --> 01:43:49.222
Anya, yesterday it wasn't the sea,
but just a lake.

01:43:49.262 --> 01:43:51.789
Great opportunity
to learn to swim.

01:43:51.936 --> 01:43:53.542
Let's bring playing cards too.

01:43:53.896 --> 01:43:55.834
Let's play poker!

01:43:55.888 --> 01:43:58.229
That's right joker,
if poker is gambling.

01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:45.122
Hey, Loid!

01:49:45.788 --> 01:49:50.050
I have brought it
McNally's cherry liqueur!

01:49:50.607 --> 01:49:52.510
